I'm Kevin. I'm a Computer Scientist.

I enjoy attempting to derive from first principles -- in math, programming or in real life's decision making. Professionally, I do work in Data Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering, Software Engineering and Quantitative Analysis.

On this website I try to share my views in order to force myself to condense and distill thoughts and ideas freely floating around in my mind. Moreover, I don't write with the primary intention to let others know. Rather, I have the intention to be transparent and increase my attack surface - making it easier for people to let me know what and how I can do better. If nevertheless someone happens to take something away from my writing, all the better!

In the past I have found great pleasure in or appreciated:
- berries
- building things
- Clojure
- convexity
- cumin
- day raves
- Emacs (and Org Mode)
- experimental Hip Hop
- fasting
- Functional Programming
- journaling
- Marc Aurel's Meditations
- [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)
- Nassim Nicholas Taleb's Incerto
- nutmeg
- [Paul Graham's essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html)
- proofs in Discrete Mathematics
- tiling window managers
- transparency
- vermouth
- violent yet vulnerable guitar music
- watching animals
