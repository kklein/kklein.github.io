I'm Kevin. I'm a Computer Scientist. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kevkle) and [GitHub](https://github.com/kklein).

I enjoy attempting to derive from first principles -- in math, programming or in real life's decision making. Professionally, I do work in Data Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering, Software Engineering and Quantitative Analysis.

On this website I try to share my views in order to force myself to condense and distill thoughts and ideas freely floating around in my mind. Moreover, I don't write with the primary intention to let others know. Rather, I have the intention to be transparent and increase my attack surface - making it easier for people to let me know what and how I can do better. If nevertheless someone happens to take something away from my writing, all the better!

In the past I have found great pleasure in or appreciated:
- berries
