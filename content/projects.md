# Work
I am fortunate enough that some of the work done at [QuantCo](https://quantco.com/) is open source.
* [Datajudge](https://github.com/quantco/datajudge)

Datajudge is a Python data testing library. Datajudge allows for the convenient expression and testing of expectations between different data source in database. It integrates nicely with pytest.

* [pytsql](https://github.com/Quantco/pytsql) 

pytsql is a Python library and enables the execution and parametrization of raw mssql scripts. Under the hood it parses a script with an [antlr](https://www.antlr.org/) grammar.
