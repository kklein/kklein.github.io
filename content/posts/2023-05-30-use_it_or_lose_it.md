## Technical prerequisites:
* Figure out importing problems:
  * Sometimes escapes are not read as escapes.
  * Sometimes commas aren't escaped.
  * Make sure card type and deck name are specified in file!
* Set up pre-commit hook with spell checking
* Set up (potentially implement) pre-commit hook verifying csv format
* Look into automated importing

# Agenda

* Talk about why remembering matters: Circle of influence, reducing the barrier of participation
* Talk a bit about the mathematics/technicalities of Anki's spaced repitition
* Teaser some of Anki's pros: Open Source, free hosting, high degree of customization, laTeX, Audio files, image files, LÃ¼ckentexte
* Talk about my technical setup: gh repo, csv files, phone app, laptop program
* Talk about my use case: Vocabulary I bump into (both directions) and domain knowledge I bump into (one direction, usually)
  * Open a bracket: In languages, being able to define is a different skill that knowing a meaning; exercise in articulation

Cool sentence with footnote[^0].

![image](/imgs/Hn.png)

Inline formula \\(\lambda = \omega\\)

Equation $$\lambda = \omega$$

Aligned equation
$$\begin{aligned}
\Pr[x=1] &= 1 - \Pr[x=0]\\\
&= 1 - \frac{1}{2} \\\
&= \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}$$
