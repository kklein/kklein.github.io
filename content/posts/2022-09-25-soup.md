# Ingredients
* 6 stalks of celery
* 8 carrots
* 2 onions
* 1 leek
* 3 large cloves of garlic
* 1 tin of chopped tomatoes
* 1 tin of coconut milk
* 1 tin of borlotti beans
* 1 stock cube
* roughly 50g of dried shiitake
* 4 bay leaves
* 1 tablespoon of curry powder
* 1 tablespoon of sweet paprika powder
* 1 tablespoon of ground turmeric
* 1 large bunch of flat-leaved parsley

# Method
Roughly chop all of the vegetables.

Start frying the onions in a large pot. After a while add the carrots. Deglaze with some red wine or balsamic vinegar. Eventually add the garlic, celery and leek.

Once the vegetables have taken on some color, add the chopped tomatoes, an extra tin's worth of water, the coconut milk as well as the stock cube. Also add the bay leaves and dried mushrooms, along with the curry and paprika powder.

Let the soup thicken until you see fit - do try every now and then. Maybe you'd like to keep some crunch in your vegetables.

Towards the end, add a roughly chopped large bunch of parsley as well as the drained borlotti beans.

Season with salt and pepper.
