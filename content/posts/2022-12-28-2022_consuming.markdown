Just rambling about some books, music and podcasts I've been exposed to in 2022. I did a similar thing in
[2021](https://kevinkle.in/jekyll/update/2021/12/28/2021_consuming.html) and [2020](http://kevinkle.in/jekyll/update/2021/01/01/2020_consuming.html).

## Books

# What I Talk About When I Talk About Running - Haruki Murakami
I'm reading this constantly wondering why I'm reading it but never contemplating to stop.

# Faserland - Christian Kracht
The nonchalant absurdity sometimes reminded me of Jack Kerouac. So many things I couldn't relate to and so many questions I'd need to ask about. Christian Kracht's precision in descriptions and childish behaviors made me empathize a lot with a character who's certainly not a posterboy for likeableness.
