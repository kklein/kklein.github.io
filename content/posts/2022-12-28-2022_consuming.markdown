Just rambling about some books, music and podcasts I've been exposed to in 2022. I did a similar thing in
[2021](https://kevinkle.in/jekyll/update/2021/12/28/2021_consuming.html) and [2020](http://kevinkle.in/jekyll/update/2021/01/01/2020_consuming.html).

## Books

# What I Talk About When I Talk About Running - Haruki Murakami
I'm reading this constantly wondering why I'm reading it but never contemplating to stop.

# Faserland - Christian Kracht
The nonchalant absurdity sometimes reminded me of Jack Kerouac. So many things I couldn't relate to and so many questions I'd need to ask about. Christian Kracht's precision in descriptions and childish behaviors made me empathize a lot with a character who's certainly not a posterboy for likeableness.

# You Get So Lonely

# Early Retirement Extreme

# Every Love Story is a Ghost Story: A Life of David Foster Wallace - D.T. Max
For most of the book I figured the many literary details and descriptions went over my head - that I was simply not part of the target audience. The stunningly short end, where suddenly life turns immesurably somber made me rethink and make it seem as if this judgement was premature: the literary details might best explain what DFW was going through. His constant strive to be better, most importantly in walking the talk and escaping hypocrisy, are maybe best illustrated with literary jargon and details. While D.T. Max quotes stunning writing and speech from DFW, the sentence that struck me most was of his own: "I was amazed to see a stocky man [...] and that expression of a deer who wishes it was anywhere but on this road."
