TODO: Define what this really means.

Me in interaction with the micro or macro?
The micro/macro in interaction with micro/macro?

Q: Is there really such a thing as 'me and macro' or is this more
about us/them within/outside of social circle?

| Micro      | Macro       |
|------------|-------------|
| Principles | Opportunism |
| Offering   | Asking      |
| Trust      | Control     |
