As another year is coming to an end I'm curious: What does the
exercise data have to tell me? I did very similar things in
[2022](https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-12-27-2022_running/),
[2021](https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-12-27-2021_running/),
[2020](https://kevinkle.in/posts/2020-12-27-2020_running/) and
[2019](https://kevinkle.in/posts/2019-12-26-2019_running/).
