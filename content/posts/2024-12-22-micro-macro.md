Generally speaking our behaviors (both actual and ideal), morals or personalities are very sensitive to the intricate contexts of life.
It took me a while to realize that my behaviors and ideals in a given dimension are sensitive to whether I'm under the impression of dealing
with an individual -- 'micro' -- or with an entity, an abstract organization or society as a whole -- 'macro'.

The following are few tendencies of mine I believe to have observed. In these dimensions, the behavior and morals I live and expect depend a lot on micro vs. macro:

| Micro                                         | Macro                    |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Loyalty                                       | Opportunism              |
| Principles                                    | Pragmatism               |
| Trust                                         | Control                  |
| Offering                                      | Requesting               |
| Strongly prefer a posteriori information [^0] | Use a priori information |

It follows that situations in which it's not clear as to whether one is dealing with micro or macro are really hard to navigate. I am loyal to, would never steal from, and by default trust the quality of w from the charming next door coffee shop. I would ditch a coffee chain for the next best alternative, potentially consider taking advantage of it and expect the worst from a it. I figure I would kernel panic if the next door coffee shop finds itself in the process of scaling up and I no longer know what regime to follow.

[^0]: What's consiered before or after the observation of evidence clearly relies on an arbitrary definition. What I'm trying to get at is that I would like to learn about people when dealing with people, give them a chance; not punish or reward them for summary statistics which other individuals with common a priori properties have shaped.
