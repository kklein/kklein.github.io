I once added a P.S. to a post card with a poem of mine:

> An excerpt from a series of poems from the uncanny valley between
> obviously too bad to be meant seriously and just bad but
> respectable.

DFW, The Depressed person, BIwHM

> The word "pathetic", the therapist candidly shared, often felt to
> her like a defense-mechanism the depressed person used to protect
> herself against a listener's possible negative judgements by making
> it clear that the depressed person was already judging herself far
> more severely than any listener could possibly have the heart to.


DFW, 'Pop Quiz 9', BIwHM

> There are right and fruitful ways to try to 'empathize' with the
> reader, but having to try to imagine yourself _as_ the reader is not
> one of them; in fact it's perilously close to the dreaded trap of
> trying to anticipate whether the reader will 'like' something you're
> working on, and both you and the very few other fiction writers
> you're friends with know that there is no quicker way to tie
> yourself in knots and kill any human urgency in the thing you're
> working on that to try to calculate ahead of time whether that thing
> will be 'liked'.

> Plus of course it almost always turns out that the people at the
> party actually _didn't_ like you, for the simple reason that you
> seemed so invent and self-conscious the whole time that they got the
> creepy subliminal feeling that you were using the party merely as
> some sort of stage to perform on and that you barely even noticed
> them and that you'd probably left without any idea whether you even
> liked them or not, which hurts their feelings and causes them to
> dislike you [...]

Nick Cave, Sean O'Hagan, Faith, hope and carnage

> Yes, otherwise the false line, the meaningless line, will always
> ambush you when singing it live.

> It's about having a deep understanding of what you're doing but, at
> the same time, being free enough to let the chips fall where they
> may. It's about preparation, but it's also about letting things
> happen.

David Bayles & Ted Orland - Art & Fear

> What is natural and what is beautiful are, in their purest state,
> indistinguishable. Could you improve upon the Circle?

> For most artists, making good art depends upon making lots of art
> and _any_ ddevice that carries the first brushstroke to the next
> blank canvas has tangible, practical value.

> [...] J.S. Bach committed to writing a prelude and fugue in each of
> the twenty-four keys [...]

> Fears about artmaking fall into two families: fears about yourself,
> and fears about your reception by others. In a general way, fears
> about yourself prevent you from doing your _best_ work, while fears
> about your reception by others prevent you from doing hour _own_ work.


This NYT article claims that Leonard Cohen has written up to 180
verses for his masterpiece 'Hallelujah'.
