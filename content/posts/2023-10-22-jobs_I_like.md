In no particular order; probably not mutually exclusive; certaintly not collectively exhaustive

* I seldomly ask for permission.
* I don't care much for what time it is.
* I don't look for confirmation.
* I don't need technical private projects.
* I have colleagues who
  * put ideas over people
  * don't have a strong ego
  * are very driven but not totally obsessed
  * thirst for knowledge
  * take satisfaction in sharing knowledge, teaching
  * don't forget or (involuntarily) bend much of what has been discussed between people
  * think long term
  * don't die by 'done is better than perfect'
  * never hide their uncertainty
  * are aware of their weaknesses
