## Ingredients
Dough
- 300g of 00 flour
- 200g of 'pasta flour' (don't actually know what that is)
- 5 eggs
- some water

Filling
- 6 large onions
- 250g fresh ricotta (get the good, dry stuff)
- ~250g artichoke hearts
- 2 cloves of garlic
- a glug of red wine
- butter
- tbsp sugar (optional)
- thyme
- zest of one lemon
- some lemon juice
- some nutmeg
- some sweet paprika powder
- seasoning

## Method

Use a standard approach to prepare the pasta dough, see for e.g. 
[this recipe](https://leitesculinaria.com/40229/recipes-homemade-pasta-dough.html).

Slice the onions and start frying them in butter and oil. Eventually add finely chopped garlic, some thyme and
possibly some chili flakes. Add some red wine once your pan is low on moisture. Make sure not to be on too high
heat as you want the onions to fry and caramelize for a while - without starting to burn. Optionally add some sugar
at some point.

Let the onions cool off a bit and chop the artichoke hearts in the meantime.

Crumble the ricotta, grate some nutmeg and lemon zest. Combine all of the filling ingredients, add seasoning and 
some lemon juice to your liking. 

Gently fill your pasta and cook them.

Before placing them on a bed of arugula, I decided to gratinate the pasta with some cream, pecorino and a
beaten egg.

For reasons unknown to me the taste of the filling very much reminded of a ground beef filling.
I found the overall flavour to lack a hint of something I could not identify. Nevertheless I
enjoyed eating it a whole lot. In a way it tasted like classical comfort food pasta, yet surprising
me with every bite. There's something really refreshing about the filling.

Many thanks to Julie.
