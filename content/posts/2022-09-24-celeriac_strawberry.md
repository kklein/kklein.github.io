# Ingredients
* 1 large celeriac
* 250g of strawberries
* 100g hazelnuts
* 1 handful of radishes
* 1 large bunch of basil
* 3 tablespoons of tahini
* 3 large tablespoons of greek yoghurt
* 1 tablespoon of sweet paprika powder

# Method
After trimming off the skin of the celeriac, grate thin strips of it. Sauté these in some olive oil, occasionally deglazing them with balsamic vinegar.

Cut the hazelnuts in half and toast them in a dry pan until fragrant.

Chop the radishes and strawberries into thin slices. Roughly chop the basil.

Mix everything and season with salt and pepper. Depending on how much balsamic vinegar you used while sautéing the celeriac, you might want to add some more now.
