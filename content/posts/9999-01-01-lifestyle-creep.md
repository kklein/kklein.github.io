[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_creep)'s
definition of lifestyle creep looks as follows:

> Lifestyle creep, also known as lifestyle inflation, is a phenomenon
> that occurs when, as more resources are spent on standard of living,
> former luxuries become perceived necessities.

While a change of perception may have profound reasons
(e.g. perceiving one's time differently after a terminal diagnosis),
the change of perception manifested in lifestyle creep strikes me as
at least arbitrary, maybe unjustified. To me it seems as though it
just meant 'getting used' to things and taking them for granted.
The newly gained perception of something being a necessity is not due to an
inherent change of what is necessary -- e.g. one's deteriorating back
actually 'requiring' an expensive mattress.

Assuming that we are more likely to incur costs for what we consider
as necessary than for what we consider as a luxury, lifestyle creep
makes our costs or resource consumption increase.

It is debatable what the upside of this increased cost is. Given that
we merely consider these expenditures as 'necessities', it doesn't
seem too wild to me to assume that the benefits are low; we just take
more things for granted.

Hence, lifestyle creep is undesirable. In particular, its impact of
rising costs makes tech-community-common goals vaguely revolving
around financial independence substantially more challenging: not only
do we incur a compounding loss of investment due to higher
expenditures; the expenditures themselves might grow rapidly according
to the principle of lifestyle creep.

Therefore, years ago, I set out to not fall victim to lifestyle creep.

Q: Do I just do these things now or do I actually perceive them as
necessities?

No change, to my surprise:
* ANC headphones
* Keyboard
* External monitors
* Phones

Reversal (fewer resources spent on it; former necessities turn into luxuries)
* Eating many vegetables a day
* A week of deliberate isolation/solitude per year (Resource: time)
* Arch Linux (Resource: time and decision making capital)
* Having zero exposure to Windows
* Tiling window manager

[^0]: I did the math: in 2024 so far I've stayed in 5 hostels
    and 10 4 or 5 star hotels. I want to stay a person who feels
    at ease in both.

[^1]: In spring and summer, that is.
