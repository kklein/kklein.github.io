[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_creep)'s
definition of lifestyle creep looks as follows:

> Lifestyle creep, also known as lifestyle inflation, is a phenomenon
> that occurs when, as more resources are spent on standard of living,
> former luxuries become perceived necessities.

# Me rambling about this definition

To be perfectly honest, I don't find said definition to be particularly
useful.

Firstly,

> [...] as more resources are spent [...]

expresses a correlation. What I really care about is causation,
though. Let's look at these two examples to illustrate what I'm trying
to get at:

|                                                                                                  | Scenario A                         | Scenario B                         |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Person                                                                                           | Anne                               | Bob                                |
| Monthly expenditures                                                                             | Rose by 100% over the past 5 years | Rose by 100% over the past 5 years |
| House cleaning situation                                                                         | Hired a cleaner 2 years ago        | Hired a cleaner 2 years ago        |
| Perspective on hiring a cleaner                                                                  | No longer considers it a luxury    | No longer considers it a luxury    |
| Is this change of perspective considered lifestyle creep according to the definition?            | Yes                                | Yes                                |
| Substitute for time saved not cleaning                                                           | Spends more time watching tennis   | Looks after elderly mother         |
| Do I deem the change in perspective useful? (i.e. do I consider the lifestyle creep 'justified') | Not at all                         | Very much                          |


In this example, many aspects are correlated to higher age: higher
salaries, higher expenditures, more responsibilities, more people
depending on one, more societal pressure. What I really care about is
the following:

> Is my change of perception, me no longer considering something a
> luxury, arbitrarily caused by me spending more resources?

and thereby excluding the case in which more resources are spent on
standard of living, but the change of perception being caused by
something else, itself merely correlated but not caused by the
increased spending.

Secondly, I find it difficult to wrap my hand around the concept of a
necessity. I side with what Jakob Lund Fisker writes in his _Early Retirement Extreme_:

> [...] often results in normative discussions of what other people
> should need or want, which usually degenerate into discussions about
> what is possible and what is not possible. The fact that it is so
> hard to agree on which is which suggests that the differentiation
> has become meaningless and thus irrelevant. _There are no such things
> as needs and wants_. [...] Needs and wants are different in degree,
> not in kind.

Therefore I will define my own notion of lifestyle creep as follows:

> Lifestyle creep, also known as lifestyle inflation, is a phenomenon
> that occurs if a given person starts taking former luxuries **for granted**
> **because** more resources are spent on standard of living.

Now, even with this definition the presence of lifestyle creep doesn't
imply poor decision making[^2]. For instance, is it reproachable to
[...]?

One important aspect of lifestyle creep is its self-reinforcing
nature: no longer perceiving something as a luxury makes one more
likely to incur costs for it, which increases resource spending, which
turns more luxuries into non-luxuries. This can be a really powerful
effect by itself; and yet it might still join forces with missing out
on compounding of investments not made.

So in short, I would think that lifestyle creep is always very
expensive but sometimes justified.


# The actual list

Now I ask myself: with a change of spending in resources, to what
extent am I taking for granted now, what I clearly considered a luxury
5 years ago?

## Lifestyle creep list

TODO: This list still assumes the former definition (correlation).

What is the progress of taking former luxuries for granted?

## No change

To my surprise, the following this have not become more or less of a
luxury, despite higher spending:
* ANC headphones
* Keyboard
* External monitors
* Phones

## Reverse lifestyle creep

Reversal (fewer resources spent on it; former necessities turn into luxuries)
* Eating many vegetables a day
* A week of deliberate isolation/solitude per year (Resource: time)
* Arch Linux (Resource: time and decision making capital)
* Having zero exposure to Windows
* Tiling window manager


[^0]: I did the math: in 2024 so far I've stayed in 5 hostels and 10 4
    or 5 star hotels. I want to stay a person who feels
    at ease in both. I also stayed in two mountain huts but I have
    never and probably will never feel truly at ease there. The smells,
    the noises, the nervous energy...

[^1]: In spring and summer, that is.

[^2]: Assuming that one doesn't consider it a poor decision to take
    **anything** for granted.

[^3]: In terms of function; I gave up on the form of desk chairs many
    moons ago.

[^4]: I do plan on continuing to do it myself; modulo a lucky lottery ticket.
