[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_creep)'s
definition of lifestyle creep looks as follows:

> Lifestyle creep, also known as lifestyle inflation, is a phenomenon
> that occurs when, as more resources are spent on standard of living,
> former luxuries become perceived necessities.

To me the most important aspect of this change in perception is that
it is arbitrary, not justified by hard facts. The newly gained
perception of something being a necessity is not due to an
inherent change of what is necessary -- e.g. one's deteriorating back
actually 'requiring' an expensive mattress.

Assuming that we are more likely to incur costs for what we consider
as necessary than for what we consider as a luxury, lifestyle creep
makes our costs increase.

It is debatable what the upside of this increased cost is. Given that
we merely consider these expenditures as 'necessities', it doesn't
seem too wild to me to assume that the benefits are low; we just take
more things for granted.

Hence, lifestyle creep is undesirable. In particular, its impact of
rising costs makes tech-community-common goals vaguely revolving
around financial independence substantially more challenging: not only
do we incur a compounding loss of investment due to higher
expenditures; the expenditures themselves might grow rapidly according
to the principle of lifestyle creep.

Therefore, years ago, I set out to not fall victim to lifestyle creep.
