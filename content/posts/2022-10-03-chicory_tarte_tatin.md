# Ingredients

* 300g of puff pastry
* 4-6 chicory heads
* 4 onions
* 200g of gorgonzola
* 200g of mascarpone
* 3 cloves of garlic
* 1 peach
* some honey
* some dry white wine
* 10 branches of fresh thyme
* 1 tbsp of fennel seeds
* 1 tbsp of mustard seeds
* 1/4 nutmeg

# Method

Slice the onions and fry them in butter until golden brown, occasionally deglazing with a dash of white wine. Set aside.

Halve the chicory heads and cut out the toughest part of the stem, like so:

Finely chop the garlic and pick the thyme leafs from the branches. 

Add some olive oil to an oven-proof pan corresponding to the size of your tarte tatin. I would roughly aim for 30cm of diameter
Add the seeds and soon after place the chicory heads in the pan - the core facing down. Make sure the pan is well covered. Add the garlic.

Let the chicory soften in some olive oil and potentially a dash of white wine here and there. Just make sure that the
liquid you add either evaporates or is properly absorbed. Excess liquid is the nemesis of this dish.

Once you're under the impression that the chicory has already soften to some degree, add the thyme, nutmeg and a dash of honey.

Take the heat off and distribute bits and pieces of gorgonzola and mascarpone over the chicory. Add salt and pepper
according to your intuition.

Add the onions on top.

Thinly slice a pear and cover the pan with the slices.

Wrap the pan's content from above with the puff pastry dough. Try to make sure the contour is tucked in well and poke
some small holes into the dough with a fork.

Place the pan in your oven and bake according to the instructions of your puff pastry dough. Remove when the dough
looks ready.

Let it rest for a moment. Place a large enough board on your pan and swiftly flip pan and board upside down.
