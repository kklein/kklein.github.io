Just rambling about some books and music I've been exposed to in 2023. I did a similar thing in
[2022](https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-12-22-2022_consuming/),
[2021](https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-12-28-2021_consuming/) and [2020](https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-01-02-2020_consuming/).

# Books

## Le mage du Kremlin - Giuliano da Empoli

# Records

## When I Have Fears - The Murder Capital
Wow - this hit me like a train. The album I had long been waiting for without knowing about it. I don't perceive this album as
a truly 'great' album. Rather, parts of it just scratch that itch that nothing else seems to reach. 'Green and Blue' is visceral,
direct and yet not harsh or blunt. I like [this live recording](https://youtu.be/jQtbKWmIUxs) quite a bit.
[This article](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/2023/01/07/the-murder-capital-we-just-couldnt-talk-to-each-other-trust-was-a-huge-issue/)
from the Irish Times taught be the word 'suave' - meaning elegant, charming, confident - through a description of lead vocalist
James McGovern. I agree.

## On Giacometti - Hania Rani
It took me a moment to warm up to this. I think my problem is that I've been too spoiled by the sweet sweet nectar of 'Esja' - 
big footsteps to fill. I learned to put 'On Giacometti' in a different category, of a rather atmospheric and less stage-filling
nature. I'm excited for future works of hers.

## UGLY - Slowthai
I've repeatedly caught myself thinking that I find this really original. I think Slowthai does great in channeling
energy on tracks like 'Selfish', 'Fuck it Puppet', 'Tourniquet' and 'Happy'. I'm still surprised by 'Sooner' and 'UGLY' - they kind
of feels like a Babyshambles song to me, in a good way. While I didn't love the echoing chorus, I thought the verses
of 'Never Again' were solid ballad material.
Overall I admire the creative effort and most songs in isolation - the album as a whole doesn't necessarily feel super coherent.

## Selected Ambient Works 85-92 - Aphex Twin
I play this when I feel like electronic music but am in presence of people who aren't into electronic music. It's crazy to think
that feels quite modern - or maybe actually modern retro - to me. I'm not sure what this says about what.

## Bright Green Field - Squid
This cannot be described. I'm glad this kind of music exists.

## Horizon Problems - Geju


## Scaring the Hoes - JPEGMafia and Danny Brown

## v2.0 - GoGo Penguin
