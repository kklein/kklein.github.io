# Ingredients
Serves two for a rather light or one for a truly lavish lunch.

* 1 large kohlrabi
* 100g baby spinach
* 8 radishes
* 200g greek yoghurt
* 100g blueberries
* 100g hazelnuts
* 4 tablespoons tahini
* half a bunch of parsley
* half a bunch of mint
* 1 heaped teaspoon of cumin
* 1 heaped teaspoon of smoked sweet paprika
* 1 teaspoon of sumac
* 1 teaspoon of coarse mustard
* black sesame seeds
* juice of 1 lemon

# Method

Grate thin strips of kohlrabi with some kind of a grater. While I generally despise underutilized specialized tools - especially in the kitchen - this tool [^0] did indeed do me a great service.

Wash your spinach and mix it with the grated kohlrabi. Thinly slice the radish while toasting the hazelnuts in a dry pan until fragrant. Very roughly chop the hazelnuts. Add hazelnuts, and radishes to the mix as well.

In order to compose the dressing, mix the greek yoghurt, tahini and lemon juice in a bowl. You can also add the spices and herbs at this point already. The mixture might look way too thick to serve as a dressing. It still 'works', though.

Combine everything and season with salt and pepper. Add the blueberries at a late point in time as to not crush them prematurely.

[^0]: Is it a grater? Is it a slicer? Is it a plane? I'm not sure. I suddenly 'found' it in my kitchen. My best guess is that it's a cheese slicer.
