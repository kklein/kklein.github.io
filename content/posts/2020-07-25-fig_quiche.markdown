## Ingredients
- 300g shortcrust dough
- large bunch of basil
- ~200g Soft, creamy goat cheese, e.g. Chavroux
- ~400g of figs (both fresh and dried are ok)
- 4-6 red onions
- 2 cloves of garlic
- zest of one lemon
- ~3 eggs
- ~80ml cream <sup id="a0">[[0]](#f0)</sup>
- some lemon juice
- some nutmeg
- some sweet paprika powder
- seasoning

## Method
Slice the red onions in rings and fry them under medium-high heat with both olive oil and 
butter. Consider adding more oil to get to where you want to be. The onions having taken on
some color, add finely chopped garlic and maybe a bit of finely chopped seedless chili.
Once things are starting to dry up again, add a glug of red wine. Consider repeating
this step with some honey.

Coarsely chop the figs, goat cheese and basil. Mix with the onions.

Spread out the dough in the shape of your choice and cover it with your filling.

In a separate bowl, swirl up the eggs and cream. Pour the liquid over the filling and gently mix
things up with a spoon. Add the lemon zest, seasoning, some paprika, some nutmeg and a tad of lemon juice;
beware not to add too much liquid though. Excess of liquid and subsequent soaking of the dough is the ultimate
nemesis for quiche, imho. Depending on how sweet your figs are (or how bad your day has been) you might want
to consider drizzling some extra honey on top.

Place in the oven at around 220 degrees C until looking like a milion bucks.

## Thoughts
* Sprinkling some fresh thyme or rosemary into the red onions could have been interesting.
* I find that this quiche goes particularly well with a spinach salad.
* Having some nuts, e.g. pecans, in the quiche could also be interesting taste-wise. Yet, 
I'm not sure if the crunchy texture would work well in the midst of creaminess.
