Just rambling about some music I've been exposed to in 2023. I did a similar thing in
[2022](https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-12-22-2022_consuming/),
[2021](https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-12-28-2021_consuming/) and
[2020](https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-01-02-2020_consuming/).

# Books

## Manorism - Sode, Yomi

## Art and Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking - David Bayles
Somehow this book felt very 'American' to me. I think I expected
something a little more insightful; I don't know why I expected that, though.

## Conversations with Friends - Sally Rooney
Reading this I felt as though I was indulging in a guilty
pleasure. Most certainly very captivating.

## The Agony and The Ecstasy - Irvine Stone
This is a large book and it demanded quite a bit of patience on my as
well as the book's end to get us through this.
I definitely learned about scuplture, art history and the church. What
struck me most, though, was how Michelangelo was portrayed as a pawn,
effortlessly moved around by the powerful. I perceived the writing as
though his dedication and superiority made him important, but stripped
him of all powers and self-determination.

## Dried-Up in meetings & other short stories - Mir Jalal
Refreshingly simple; at times beautifully absurd, at times a little
bland to read.

## Women - Charles Bukowski
I thought that the noise of promiscuity and drinking and ruthlesness made the few,
somewhat serene moments of virtue (or rather absence of vices)
quite powerful; they struck me.
