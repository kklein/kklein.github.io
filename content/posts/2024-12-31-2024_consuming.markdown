Just rambling about some music I've been exposed to in 2023. I did a similar thing in
[2022](https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-12-22-2022_consuming/),
[2021](https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-12-28-2021_consuming/) and
[2020](https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-01-02-2020_consuming/).

# Records

## Quaranta - Danny Brown

## Only For Dolphins - Action Bronson

## Sour Soul - BADBADNOTGOOD

## FABRICLIVE 59 - Four Tet

## Space Heavy - King Krule

## The Sunset Violent - Mount Kimbie

# Books

## Manorism - Sode, Yomi

## Art and Fear: Observations on the Perils (and Rewards) of Artmaking - David Bayles
Somehow this book felt very 'American' to me. I think I expected
something a little more insightful; I don't know why I expected that, though.

## Conversations with Friends - Sally Rooney
Reading this I felt as though I was indulging in a guilty
pleasure. Most certainly very captivating.
