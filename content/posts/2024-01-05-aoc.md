2023 came with another edition of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), an
[advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) with programming challenges.

In many was - e.g. the assessment of both performance of and correctness on official leaderboards - the programming
challenges are similar to regular programming competitions. Yet, there is also a large part of the community
approaching advent of code more casually: people playing around with funky programming languages (e.g. [Nix](https://github.com/crazazy/aoc2020) or [Nim](https://github.com/eversinc33/Red-Team-Advent-of-Code)) or people [streaming their daily programming sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmIcX2SHojI).

Given that lots of data around Advent of Code exists online, I sought out to answer theses questions:
1. How does the number of leaderboard submissions evolve over time?
2. Where do participants come from?
3. Which programming languages do people use?
