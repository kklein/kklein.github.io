[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestyle_creep)'s
definition of lifestyle creep looks as follows:

> Lifestyle creep, also known as lifestyle inflation, is a phenomenon
> that occurs when, as more resources are spent on standard of living,
> former luxuries become perceived necessities.

# Me rambling about this definition

To be perfectly honest, I don't find said definition to be particularly
useful.

Firstly,

> [...] as more resources are spent [...]

expresses a correlation. What I really care about is causation,
though.

Secondly, I find it difficult to wrap my hand around the concept of a
necessity. I side with what Jakob Lund Fisker writes in his _Early Retirement Extreme_:

> [...] often results in normative discussions of what other people
> should need or want, which usually degenerate into discussions about
> what is possible and what is not possible. The fact that it is so
> hard to agree on which is which suggests that the differentiation
> has become meaningless and thus irrelevant. _There are no such things
> as needs and wants_. [...] Needs and wants are different in degree,
> not in kind.

Therefore I will define my own notion of lifestyle creep as follows:

> Lifestyle creep, also known as lifestyle inflation, is a phenomenon
> that occurs if a given person starts taking former luxuries **for granted**
> **because** more resources are spent on standard of living.

One important aspect of lifestyle creep is its self-reinforcing
nature: no longer perceiving something as a luxury makes one more
likely to incur costs for it, which increases resource spending, which
turns more luxuries into non-luxuries. This can be a really powerful
effect by itself; and yet it might still join forces with missing out
on compounding of investments not made.

This effect can be seen in the following animation: in the 'no lifestyle creep' scenario
the costs of living don't increase while the income increases by 10% a year; in the 'lifestyle creep'
scenario, costs grow as fast as income. The y-axis represents cumulative costs over the years -- its
unit being the yearly income at year 0.

I would tend to think that lifestyle creep is always very expensive but sometimes justified.

# The actual list(s)

Now I ask myself: to what extent am I taking for granted now, what I considered a luxury
5 years ago due to increased spending [^2]?
What is the 'progress' of taking former luxuries for granted?

## No change

To my surprise, the following have not become more or less of a
luxury, despite higher spending:
* ANC headphones
* Keyboard
* External monitors
* Phones

## Reverse lifestyle creep

Previously, the spending referred to money. Yet, if I relax this restriction to any resource,
I notice some 'reverse' lifestyle creep: what I formerly took for granted, turned into a luxury
due to decreased resource allocation in a given resource dimension:

* Eating many many vegetables a day
* Spending time in deliberate isolation
* Having zero exposure to Windows[^5]
* Having a neat tiling window manager
* Having a neat Arch Linux setup

[^0]: I did the math: in 2024 I stayed in 5 ho**s**tels and 10 4
    or 5 star hotels. I want to stay a person who feels
    at ease in both. I also stayed in two mountain huts but I have
    never and probably will never feel truly at ease there. The smells,
    the noises, the nervous energy...

[^1]: In spring and summer, that is.

[^2]: Of course, I cannot really know what change is due to my change in income and spending
    or other changing covariates such as age, philosophy etc. I'll try to guess the causes of the effects.

[^3]: In terms of function; I gave up on the form of desk chairs many
    moons ago.

[^4]: I do plan on continuing to do it myself; modulo a lucky lottery ticket.

[^5]: The resource in question being political/decision making capital (integrity?)?
