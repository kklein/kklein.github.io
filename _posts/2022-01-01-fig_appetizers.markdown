Quick to make, satisfying to eat.

## Ingredients
* Puff pastry
* Figs (preferably fresh ones; if not, dried ones are ok, too)
* Ricotta
* Rocket

## Method

Cut some parts of the puff pastry. I figure both rectangles and squares should work. While all sizes 'go', I think that in principle one wants to use as little dough per fixed filling size as possible. In the same vein, I would try to make the pastry as thin as possible.

Spread a mixture of ricotta, roughly ground black pepper, salt and ground nutmeg. Top with pieces of fig and some rocket. I later discovered that this works much better if one clump up the rocket first.

One can either try to fold them or to knit them together like a dumpling. I tried both and both worked okay. Since there is not much liquid inside, it's not important for it to be sealed.

Bake according to your puff pastry instructions til looking good.

## Closing remarks

Being mindful of sharing negative results (:)), I do not recommend adding extra honey on top if your figs are either dried or on the sweeter side. Sesame seeds, on the other hand, could have been a good addition - both inside as well as outside of the puff pastry.

In retrospect I'm curious as to how some mustard seeds would've fared in the ricotta mixture.
