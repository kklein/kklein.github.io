I caught myself making the mistake of thinking I wasn't holding
expectations when in fact, I was.

When telling myself to not have a certain expectation against someone,
I did usually make sure to control my behaviour towards them. If I
anticipated that I shouldn't have the expectation of an event taking
place, I made sure not to make the responsible person feel
negatively about the non-event. I figured that not holding the
expectation would mean that I may not act upset or angry towards them.

The mistake I made was to think about the latter as sufficient condition to claim to
'not have had the expectation' instead of regarding it as simply one of several
implications.

Not having an expectation against someone means both not _acting_
negatively towards that person as well as not thinking or feeling negatively
_inside_, independently of the behaviour, i.e. act, displayed towards others.
