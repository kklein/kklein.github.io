As another year is coming to an end I'm curious: What has my running looked like this year? I did something similar in [2020](http://kevinkle.in/jekyll/update/2020/12/26/2020_running.html) as well as in [2019](http://kevinkle.in/jekyll/update/2019/12/27/2019_running.html).

# The gist of it

|              |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |   2021 |
|--------------|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| distance [km] |    430 |    962 |   1295 |   1381 |
| avg distance [km] |  6.61 |   9.08 |  10.53 |  11.05 |
| #runs | 65 | 107 | 123 | 124 |
| #sports activities | 81 | 135 | 210 | 231 |
| share of running among sports activities| 80.25% | 79.26% | 58.57% | 53.68%
| max duration between 2 runs [days] | 36 | 26 | 18 | 38 |
| #weeks without running | 16 | 5 | 4 | 7 |

After picking up going to the gym in late 2019 and starting to cycle every now and then in 2020, I made 
the tail end of activities a little longer by hiking, playing tennis, bouldering and swimming just a couple of times -
hence the lower share of running.

The stark increase in the maximal duration between two runs seems to be the consequence of an injury-ridden spring.

# A bit more than the gist of it

The top-left plot, comprising all runs of 2021 and their respective distances, also indicates the injury with a 
gaping hole roughly between April and June. Also, it shows both of my attempts to run above-marathon distance.

The top-right plot still shows some mass of runs between 10am and 4pm, yet I seem to have shifted more runs into morning and
evening than before.

I figure one could try to read the impact of pollen into the bottom-left plot - since even in 2020 my running tanked
enormously in May. At the same time, my dim memory tells me that I had some light but non-negligible injury in the
summer of 2020 as well. Independently of the cause(s), I seem to have fared better in regaining momentum in the second half
of 2021 than in 2020.

Overall, it seems like my running might have become a bit more consistent at the monthly aggregation level. This is also 
indicated by the bottom-right histogram of monthly distances across years.

Talking about consistency: Have I been able to accumulate much volume along the span of two weeks?

Sort of?

# Heart rate
While previously an avid refuser of any running gear of non-trivial sophistication, I let my injury and the physiotherapist
convince me to purchase a watch monitoring my heart rate. The purpose not merely being observation
but rather intervention, I was instructed to start running in ['zone 1' or 'zone 2'](https://www.runnersworld.com/beginner/a20812270/should-i-do-heart-rate-training/).

Quickly did I figure out that this is far from what I'd been used to. My standard feel-good running pace had usually been
below 5'/km. It turned out that this would usually bring me either to the devilish zone 3 or the to-be-savoured-in-small-quantities zone 4. :S:S:S

As a consequence, I had to reduce my running pace by roughly 50%. This was pretty challenging and took me a long time to get accustomed to.

Given this, I'm pleasantly surprised that my yearly running volume didn't drop too much - neither due to no longer being able to afford the time to run similar distances 
at a substantially slower pace nor due to it breaking my morale.

Anyhow - [some people claim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fUvTtVfPzE&) that running in aforementioned zone 2 will diminish heart rates for a given pace in any zone and thereby implicitly 'make you faster'. Hopeful that my sacrifice in speed would also be of some benefit other than preventing injury - what's the worth of that after all - I wondered:

> Has my heart rate gotten lower for a fixed pace?

The above question is extremely hard to answer truthfully since the data is neither constant nor independently random across all other dimensions - sleep, weather, distance, elevation, prior
exhaustion and motivation to only name a few. I figured, it could still be that averaging across months, a useful trend could prevail.

I have resorted to using the Strava API to tackle a proxy for that question. Strava, a second source of running data of mine, connects to my watch and stores both
heart rate and pace data.

"Something, something negatives results", right?
