## An examplary change of opinion: Messaging
# Previous position

I vividly remember claiming that messaging people one doesn't talk to on a regular basis seems pointless, as long as there wasn't a very specific topic to discuss, which required a lot of groundwork to be layed out already. I figured that the usually very reduced bandwidth, due to the generally low priority that messaging is suffering from and quite simply typing, was reason enough for nothing _meaningful_ to come out of it. Such messaging often started off great but had inevitably been followed by neglect, typically bilaterally.

# Current position

My assessment on the effect of sheer signaling has changed. I now think that expressions of attentiveness can be richer than previously assumed. I still think that many conversations die a slow death of drying out, with ever-increasing off-sets between individual messages. And I still do think that that is negative, as it indicates a mismatch between some expectation and reality.

What has changed is that I no longer believe that such a scenario will most likely be a net negative. I think the initial excitement can trump the downside of what might come after.

## Meta observation

Quickly did I realize that this was my initial position was unconventional. Hence I was adamant about finding out whether people or I were wrong. I brought this claim up frequently and mostly people seemed slightly skeptical, partly alienated. Still they did not _voice_ any concerns or doubts. Out of at least 20 people I presented this idea, there was one single person who challenged it.

Now, years later, I changed my mind.

Challenge your dear ones. Not doing so is not caring. It is wasteful.
