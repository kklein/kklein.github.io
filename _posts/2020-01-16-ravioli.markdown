## Ingredients
Dough
- 300g of 00 flour
- 200g of 'pasta flour' (don't actually know what that is)
- 5 eggs
- some water

Filling
- 6 large onions
- 250g fresh ricotta (get the good, dry stuff)
- ~250g artichoke hearts
- 2 cloves of garlic
- a glug of red wine
- butter
- tbsp sugar (optional)
- thyme
- zest of one lemon
- some lemon juice
- some nutmeg
- some sweet paprika powder
- seasoning

## Method
PASTA

Slice the onion and start frying them in butter and oil. Eventually add finely chopped garlic, some thyme and
possibly some chili flakes. Once your pan is low on moisture, add some red wine. Make sure not to be on too high
heat as you want the onions to fry and caramelize for a while - without starting to burn. Optionally add some sugar
at some point.

Let the onions cool off a bit and chop the artichoke hearts in the meantime.

Crumble the ricotta, grate some nutmeg and lemon zest. Combine all of the filling ingredients, add seasoning and 
some lemon juice to your liking. 

FILL AND COOK PASTA

Optional: grattin, place on bed of rocket.
