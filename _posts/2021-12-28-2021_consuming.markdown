Just rambling about some books, podcasts and records I've been exposed to a bunch over 2020.

# Books

* First Person Singular - Haruki Murakami



# Podcasts


# Records

* Veteran - Jpegmafia
Was going to be my favorite album of the year until...

* All My Heros Are Cornballs - Jpegmafia
I think this is the first time I actually discovered something thanks to Anthony Fantano hype that I ended up being in love with. I have to say I have gotten really obsessed with peggi at this point. I have really enjoyed his appearance at the [Cambridge Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UjNTHSIqU8).

* Portishead - Dummy
I'm always fascinated by 'artists' artists'. Still, it took me a long time to finally drill down on Dummy. I had heard Kanye, Asap Rocky and Thom Yorke rave about it. In line with my ... I find this fascinating - yet it remains at a distance.

* Colour - Matthew Halsall
When reaching for jazz I typically listen to older stuff. With Matthew Halsall I now have someone up my sleeve whom I could actually still go to a concert from.

* Dreams - Gabor Szabo
I've finally found this album again - it must have been many years ago since I came across it. Wonderfully playful and lighthearted while never seeming superficial.

* Roadrunner - Brockhampton
Just like almost any other work of theirs, this somehow doesn't _feel_ like an album to me. I figure I have above-average tolerane for a not overly spectacular song inbetween lighthouses if it fits in with the picture. Tracks like 'COUNT ON ME', 'I'LL TAKE YOU ON' and 'OLD NEWS' really pull me out of the flow. Nevertheless, I've came back to this record a lot for 'BUZZCUT', 'CHAIN ON', 'THE LIGHT' and 'WHAT'S THE OCCASION' and 'BANKROLL' just feel incredibly catchy.

* Listen to My Song: The Music City Sessions - Darondo
I can get too much of it but if I don't this is pure gold. If I was rapping I think I'd be perfectly happy restraining myself to samples from this record.
