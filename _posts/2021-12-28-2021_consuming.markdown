Just rambling about some books, podcasts and records I've been exposed to a bunch over 2020.

# Books

* First Person Singular - Haruki Murakami

* Algorithms to Live By -  Brian Christian, Tom Griffith

* The Almanack of Naval -  Eric Jorgenson

* A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again: Essays and Arguments - David Foster Wallace
I much prefered the short story about the dynamics of professional tennis over DFW's hesitant adventures on the high seas. The distinguishing quality might have been that the tennis story felt like a nest positive description while the cruise essay seemed purely negative. My impression is that DFW also tries to convey a lot of criticism and scepticism towards tennis, yet can't help but let some raw rays of juvenile sunshine through his cover of rationality. This was cute. Maybe the classic 'you dislike with other what you dislike with yourself' hits here: he might have reminded me of my occasional doom and gloom a tad too much. :)

* Ham on Rye - Charles Bukowski
I devoured this (no pun intended). Does having (some) sympathy for Charles Bukowski make me a 'bad person'?

* Behave - Robert Sapolsky
I would indeed want Robert Sapolsky to be my uncle. He makes me wonder what the antonym of 'oblivious' is. I want to learn from him, laugh with him, hug him - preferably all at the same time. Now after these positive words I hope to be off the hook: this book wasn't for me. The first, very long, two thirds of the book felt like a list of abstracts: some biology facts from a study but not quite the whole thing. This format culminated in a very dissatisfying situation for me personally: the strain and concentration of reading scientific literature without the ensuing depth of knowledge and insight; the fleeting nature and perceived irrelevance of anecdotes and individual studies without the scrumptious story-telling of a pure pop-science writer. The last thirds was more satisfying to read but. Yet came with a kind of content, lightly dabbling in recent history, cognitive science and psychology, that I've likely already had my fair share of in these recent years - maybe packaged better elsewhere.

* Normal People - Sally Rooney
Incredibly captivating - I most certainly haven't read anything like this. Beautifully tragic.


# Podcasts

* Conversations with Tyler - Tyler Cowen
While I haven't been as lucky with it as in previous years, I would still consider it a safe bet. I found Tyler to be incredibly wholesome when describing the visual features of dogs employed in truffle hunts. :)

* Huberman Lab - Andrew Huberman
TODO

* Broken Record - Rick Rubin, Malcolm Gladwell, Bruce Headlam, Justin Richmond
The episode with Kevin Abstract stuck in my mind. Their discussion would only require minimal abstraction to serve as a general meditation on project management. Surprisingly unsurprisingly Rick Rubin suggested artificial constraints, in this case in the form of severe time pressure, as a catalyst for creativity. I thought it was very interesting to hear Kevin Abstract's dry acknowledgment on how Brockhampton has collectively and continuously lost excitement about the process of making music.


# Records

* Veteran - Jpegmafia
Was going to be my favorite album of the year until...

* All My Heros Are Cornballs - Jpegmafia
I think this is the first time I actually discovered something thanks to Anthony Fantano hype that I ended up being in love with. I have to say I have gotten really obsessed with pegi at this point. I have really enjoyed his appearance at the [Cambridge Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UjNTHSIqU8).

* LP! - Jpegmafia
Just when I thought I had hit my Jpegmafia summit of enthusiasm, he released this record. I am blown away by this man. This album, 'REBOUND!' to be precise, even made me tolerate (possibly like?) horns in a rap track - a stern previous taboo of mine.

* Portishead - Dummy
I'm always fascinated by 'artists' artists'. Still, it took me a long time to finally drill down on Dummy. I had heard Kanye, Asap Rocky and Thom Yorke rave about it. In line with my ... I find this fascinating - yet it remains at a distance.

* Colour - Matthew Halsall
When reaching for jazz I typically end up with older stuff. With Matthew Halsall I now have someone up my sleeve whom I could actually still go to a concert from.

* Dreams - Gabor Szabo
I've finally found this album again - it must have been many years ago since I last came across (and lost track of) it. Wonderfully playful and lighthearted while never seeming superficial.

* Roadrunner - Brockhampton
Just like almost any other work of theirs, this somehow doesn't _feel_ like an album to me. I figure I have above-average tolerane for a not overly spectacular song inbetween lighthouses if it fits in with the picture. Tracks like 'COUNT ON ME', 'I'LL TAKE YOU ON' and 'OLD NEWS' really pull me out of the flow. Nevertheless, I've came back to this record a lot for 'BUZZCUT', 'CHAIN ON', 'THE LIGHT' and 'WHAT'S THE OCCASION' and 'BANKROLL' just feel incredibly catchy.

* Listen to My Song: The Music City Sessions - Darondo
I can very easily get too much of it. If I don't this is pure gold. If I was rapping I think I'd be perfectly happy restraining myself to samples from this record.

* Atrocity Exhibition - Danny Brown
At first, I had a hard time to look past the vocal similarity Cypress Hill - of which I don't naturally long for more of. Once I was able to pick up more facets of the music, I started appreciating it. This album remains demanding.

* Crawler - Idles
The release of the first single, Car Crash, gave me a weird feeling. I definitely liked the track but couldn't imagine what the album behind it could look like. The baseline accompanied by whispering gave me some System of a Down vibes. Evoking this feeling is cool at first sight but likely not sustainable or desirable on their end.
This album is not made for me. Neither was it hitting me in a visceral way that 'Mother', '1049 Gotho' or 'Never Fight a Man With a Perm' did, nor did it make me chuckle out of suprise they wayq uite a few tracks off of 'Joy as an Act of Resistance' did. Does the 'the first two albums are the only good' curse hit the Idles as well?

* Call Me If you Get Lost - Tyler the Creator
I can usually admire music for two distinct reasons: a visceral transmission of raw, unfiltered, overwhelming emotion or as a refined, piece of craftsmanship appreciated from a safe distance. Astonishingly, his two previous albums made me have both - albeit never on the same track. This album didn't evoke any of both in me. I really wanted to like it. Also: a bit too much 80s for my taste.

# Music: Diverse

* [Sarah Kreis @ Bucht der Träumer 2018](https://soundcloud.com/sarahkreis/sarah-kreis-bucht-der-traumer?si=340f04c6ff2f4ebe881e2e2e8be2409c&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing)
I'm pretty sure this was the first recorded set of Sarah Kreis which I listened to. To this day it's still my favorite one - her [set with Caleesi in Oaxaca from 2019](https://soundcloud.com/sarahkreis/caleesi-sarah-kreis-mezcal-amores-2019?si=1353248c2b8c4ec4a8b78522ace913d4&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) likely coming in second.

* Peach - Kevin Abstract
So, I guess I like a _pop_ song, now? I wouldn't mind only having verses on this one.

* [Gilles Peterson, Boiler Room London](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=6NVmWbQZ8yU&list=RDAMVM6NVmWbQZ8yU)
I figure this has to be the Swiss Army Knife™ of music for social settings: almost never perfect, almost always useful.

* [Silver Couplets - The Districts (Live)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=zT-eeg5pTIU&list=RDAMVMzT-eeg5pTIU)
I don't really have to say much, I just like it a lot.

* [Funeral Beds - The Districts (HotBox session)](https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=fTLqyoVV9EU&list=RDAMVMfTLqyoVV9EU)
Makes me feel much younger than I am.
