## Ingredients

Serves 4 okay-ish hungry people.

### Tofu
- 1kg smoked tofu
- 1kg green beans
- 500 ml coconut milk
- ~500g shortcrust dough
- 2 cans of chickpeas
- 3 carrots
- 3 large yellow onions
- 3 gloves of garlic
- soy sauce
- black bean sauce
- tomato purée
- soy sauce
- red wine
- 1 egg

## Method

Strain your chickpeas and separate them out in a baking tray. Put them in the oven around 200 degrees Celsius until they are nice and crispy. You might add some curcuma, ground cumin or sweet paprika at this point.

Slice the onions, dice the garlic and cut your carrots into half-circles. Trim off the ends of your garden beans and halve them width-wise. 

Start sautéing the carrots and continuously add onions, beans, cumin seeds, fennel seeds and garlic in that order. Start off with olive oil and once the vegetables are starting to pick up the heat deglaze with a dash of a, preferably hearty, red wine. Rinse and repeat. Towards the end, add black bean sauce and soy sauce.

In a different pan, slightly fry the 1cm-cubed smoked tofu. Once it starts getting crispy, add plenty of tomato purée, honey and soy sauce.

Once everything is done, combine it all in a pot and pour in the coconut milk. Let the flavours mix without really cooking anything much further. Try to thicken up the collective - if needed, add some corn starch - after all, we don't want neither want a leaky pie nor a pie with a mushy bottom. Once you feel it's done, add a bunch of picked basil.

In your baking dish line out dough - fill it and put a lid on top. Make sure to poke some holes in the lid - possibly also in the bottom. Glaze with a bit of egg wash, place it in the oven around 180 degrees celsius and patiently wait til it's looking great. :)
