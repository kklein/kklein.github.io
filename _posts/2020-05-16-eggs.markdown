Yadda yadda. 

## Ingredients
- 8 eggs
- 1 cup of white balsamic vinegar
- 1/2 cup of liquid from tinned beets
- 2 tbsp cardamon pods
- 2 tbsp cumin seeds
- 2 tbsp coriander seeds
- 2 tbsp pepper corns
- 1 tbsp fennel seeds
- 1 tbsp mustard seeds
- a few cloves
- a few bay leaves
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 2 tbsp curry powder
- 2 tbsp turmeric
- 2 tbsp sweet paprika powder
- 2 tbsp salt
- 3 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp garam masala

## Method
Boil the eggs as little as possible while making sure they're actually boiled. If you found just the right spot, make
sure to put them into ice water as to prevent them continuing to cook themselves. 


In the meantime toast your whole spices in a dry pan on medium heat until your kitchen smells like a market in a
far-flung exotic place. Eventually add the beet juice and ground spices to combine everything well. In particular, 
make sure the sure is well disolved. Let cool for a bit.


Add your spice mixture and the vinegar into your mason jar.


Peel your hard-boiled eggs and add them, too.
