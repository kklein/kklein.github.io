Yet another year's almost over. Let's have a look at my year 2020 in running, just as I did [last year](http://kevinkle.in/jekyll/update/2019/12/27/2019_running.html) in 2019.

# Context

Share of running compared to other sports activities.

# Yearly comparison

|              |   2017 |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |
|--------------|-------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
|distance [km] |    354 |    430 |    962 |   1295 | 
| avg distance [km] |   5.62 |   5.61 |   9.08 |  10.53 |

# Individual runs

First, let's get a feel for what we are talking about by looking into all runs throughout
the year:

![individual runs](/imgs/2020_running/individual_runs.png){:class="img-responsive"}

It becomes apparent that the spread in distances is fairly wide and that there is
no glaring training effect, indicated by a growing average with high concentration. Also,
we can observe that I stopped going for 'longer', i.e. >16 km runs in August.

> Why are there super short-distance runs, <5 km?

While I'm no longer sure, I think those were partly interruptions due to injuries and partly
treadmill warm-ups at the gym.

In terms of the temporal distribution of runs, nothing obvious strikes me. This raises the
question (that is, at least in my head):

> What was the longest duration between two runs?

In October, there was a sequence of 19 days without running. [I'm totally okay with this and
it doesn't bother me at all that I hadn't been running for more than *two and a half weeks*.](https://images.app.goo.gl/m2PyESKEHdHRKBMc7)

Shifting the focus back to good news, let's look into the longest runs.

> What were the top 10 distances?

| rank | distance [km] |
| ----:|------:|
| 1 | 22.20 |
| 2 | 22.20 |
| 3 | 22.00 |
| 4 | 21.19 |
| 5 | 21.00 |
| 6 | 20.00 |
| 7 | 19.78 |
| 8 | 19.42 |
| 9 | 18.25 |
| 10 | 18.02 |

Considering that only before 2019, my 2nd longest run ever had been 12.97 km, this is a
significant change even though it didn't feel like one. Nice.

We also just learned that the longest run or maximum distance has been 22.20 km. Generalizing
the question, we might want to ask:

> What was the maximum distance run in _k_ consecutive days? <sup id="a0">[[0]](#f0)</sup>

|#days| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8| 9| 10|
|distance[km]|22.2| 37.67| 48.97| 61.5| 65.88| 75.5| 76.53| 90.6| 109.34| 109.34|

|#days| 11| 12| 13| 14| 15| 16| 17| 18| 19| 20| 21 |
|distance[km]|109.34| 109.34| 118.17| 127.68| 127.68| 141.32| 147.86| 147.86| 157.43| 163.93| 171.66|

One thing must not go missing in a qualitative, mostly visual, somewhat superficial, small-n analysis: a histogram.

# Weekly running
Extending the granularity of our data points a little, these are the running distances per week:

![Weekly distances](/imgs/2020_running/weekly_distances.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Just as with the individual runs, we still see a fairly broad spread in the distance dimension.

![Weekly histogram](/imgs/2020_running/weekly_distances_histogram.png){:class="img-responsive"}

The same pictures is painted by the historam/empirical denisities. Will this variation even out
if aggregating over months?


# Montly running

![Monthly distance](/imgs/2020_running/monthly_distances.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Yes indeed. While the previous years still came with greater spread in cumulative distance
across months, 2020 looks pretty stable around ~90 km. Looking at the average run distance
across months we also observe greater concentration around the mean:

![Monthly average](/imgs/2020_running/monthly_average_distances.png){:class="img-responsive"}

What we've noted very qualitatively can also be seen more quantitatively: the empirical
densities indicate a higher peak in 2020:

![Monthly densities](/imgs/2020_running/monthly_densities.png){:class="img-responsive"}

So we observe a higher peak for 2018, at lower distance and a high peak for 2020 at a greater
distance. 2019 being more widespread could allow for the post-hoc rationalization of 2019
being a 'transitionary year': similar to the somewhat homegeneous 2018 at first but then setting
the trend of the similarly homegeneous 2020.

problem, we, programmers, have been waiting for.
