Yet another year's almost over. Let's have a look at my year 2020 in running, just as I did [in 2019](http://kevinkle.in/jekyll/update/2019/12/27/2019_running.html).

# Yearly comparison

|              |   2018 |   2019 |   2020 |
|--------------|-------:|-------:|-------:|
|distance [km] |    430 |    962 |   1295 | 
| avg distance [km] |  6.61 |   9.08 |  10.53 |
| number of runs | 65 | 107 | 123 |
| share of running among sport activities| 80.25% | 79.26% | 58.57% |

I picked up going to the gym in late 2019 and started cycling every now and then in 2020, hence
the lower share of running. I'm desperately curious about the counterfactual of how my running
would have turned out if not for the other activities.

# Individual runs

First, let's get a feel for what we are talking about by looking into all runs throughout
the year:

![individual runs](/imgs/2020_running/individual_runs.png){:class="img-responsive"}

It becomes apparent that the spread in distances is fairly wide and that there is
no glaring training effect, indicated by a growing average with high concentration. Also,
we can observe that I stopped going for 'longer', i.e. >16 km runs in August.

> Why are there super short-distance runs, <5 km?

While I'm no longer sure, I think those were partly interruptions due to injuries and partly
treadmill warm-ups at the gym.

In terms of the temporal distribution of runs, nothing obvious strikes me. This raises the
question (that is, at least in my head):

> What was the longest duration between two runs?

In October, there was a sequence of 19 days without running. [I'm totally okay with this and
it doesn't bother me at all that I hadn't been running for more than *two and a half weeks*.](https://images.app.goo.gl/m2PyESKEHdHRKBMc7)

Shifting the focus back to good news, let's look into the longest runs.

> What were the top 10 distances?

| rank | distance [km] |
| ----:|------:|
| 1 | 22.20 |
| 2 | 22.20 |
| 3 | 22.00 |
| 4 | 21.19 |
| 5 | 21.00 |
| 6 | 20.00 |
| 7 | 19.78 |
| 8 | 19.42 |
| 9 | 18.25 |
| 10 | 18.02 |

Considering that only before 2019, my second-longest run ever had been 12.97 km, this is a
significant change even though it didn't feel like one. Nice.

We also just learned that the longest run or maximum distance has been 22.20 km. Generalizing
the question, we might want to ask:

> What was the maximum distance run in _k_ consecutive days? <sup id="a0">[[0]](#f0)</sup>

| number of days | distance [km] | number of days | distance [km] |
|----:|----:|----:|----:|
| 1| 22.2| 9, 10, 11, 12|109.34|
| 2| 37.67| 13 | 118.17 |
| 3| 48.97| 14, 15 | 127.68 |
| 4| 61.5| 16 | 141.32 |
| 5| 65.88| 17, 18 |  147.86 |
| 6| 75.5| 19 |  157.43 |
| 7| 76.53| 20 |  163.93 |
| 8| 90.6|21 | 171.66|

![max distance consecutive days](/imgs/2020_running/max_window_distances.png){:class="img-responsive"}

I was surprised to see a somewhat linear-looking shape. I expected a greater tendency to
sub-linear growth, as I tend to have bursts of running - at times running what feels like a lot
in a few days - followed by perceived slacking off.

One thing must not go missing in a qualitative, mostly visual, somewhat superficial, small-n analysis: a histogram.

![run histogram](/imgs/2020_running/run_histogram.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Considering the wide spread both observed in the histogram as well as the plot of
of individual runs, I'm wondering

> Are there 'classes' of runs, depending on the time of the day?

So let's look into empirical distributions of distances by hour of the day. I used the start time of a run.

![hourly boxplot](/imgs/2020_running/hourly_distance_boxplot.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Well, not evidently, no. Talking about hours of the days:

> When did I go for runs?

![hourly histogram](/imgs/2020_running/hourly_distance_histogram.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Looks like I'm just an average Joe, really.

# Weekly running
Extending the granularity of our data points a little, these are the running distances per week:

![Weekly distances](/imgs/2020_running/weekly_distances.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Just as with the individual runs, we observe a large variance of distances covered.

![Weekly histogram](/imgs/2020_running/weekly_distances_histogram.png){:class="img-responsive"}

The same picture is painted by the histogram/empirical densities. Will this variation even out
if aggregating over months?


# Monthly running

![Monthly distance](/imgs/2020_running/monthly_distances.png){:class="img-responsive"}

Yes indeed. While the previous year still came with greater spread in cumulative distance
across months, 2020 looks pretty stable around ~90 km. Looking at the average run distance
across months we also observe greater concentration around the mean:

![Monthly average](/imgs/2020_running/monthly_average_distances.png){:class="img-responsive"}

What we've noted very qualitatively can also be seen more quantitatively: the empirical
densities indicate a higher peak in 2020:

![Monthly densities](/imgs/2020_running/monthly_densities.png){:class="img-responsive"}

So we observe a peak for 2018, at lower distance and a peak for 2020 at a greater
distance. 2019 being more widespread could allow for the post-hoc rationalization of 2019
being a 'transitory year' similar to the somewhat homogeneous 2018 at first but then setting
the trend of the similarly homogeneous 2020.

Many thanks to Lorenz for suggestions.
