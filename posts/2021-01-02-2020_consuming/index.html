worse until he didn&rsquo;t.</p><ul><li>Consider the Lobster - David Foster Wallace</li></ul><p>This was when I realized how bad at languages I am.</p><ul><li>Meditations - Marc Aurel</li></ul><p>Even though Marc Aurel&rsquo;s views are fairly explicit and specific, granting
standards of philosophy, I observed a strong interaction effect between literary source and my
state of mind on the reaction I had on the read.</p><ul><li>Siddharta - Hermann Hesse</li></ul><p>I didn&rsquo;t get it.</p><ul><li>The Descent of Man - Grayson Perry</li></ul><p>Well, at least I can say that I&rsquo;ve read a book on gender, now.</p><ul><li>Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosphy - Simon Blackburn</li></ul><p>It all makes sense looking back.</p><ul><li>Of Mice and Men - John Steinbeck</li></ul><p>For no apparent reason other than his high haptic sensitivity I identified loads with the gentle giant.</p><ul><li>L&rsquo;Etranger - Albert Camus</li></ul><p>I often don&rsquo;t like the glaring sun, either.</p><ul><li>Frappe-toi le coeur - Amélie Nothomb</li></ul><p>So many whys.</p><ul><li>All That Man Is - David Szalay</li></ul><p>It took me a New Yorker article a to appreciate some aspects of the bigger picture now seeming to be central. I&rsquo;m not
sure what this says about me, the book or the New Yorker or whether it says anything at all.</p><h1 id=podcasts>Podcasts</h1><ul><li>The Portal by Eric Weinstein</li></ul><p>Bursts of high entertainment and beautiful speech. To the point where the latter would almost veil the fact that I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to point to anything I actually took away from it.</p><ul><li>Conversations with Tyler</li></ul><p>Highest value. What really stood out for me were the discussions about
music, e.g. about the Beatles with Ted Gioia, as well as Tyler Cowen&rsquo;s overt statement
expressing that he doesn&rsquo;t understand why someone would listen to podcasts when they could
read or listen to music. Also, there was something very humble, unpretentious and relatable
about him, this complete and distinguished Renaissance man, showing love for Nirvana.</p><ul><li>France Culture</li></ul><p>Stumbled across many topics sparking interest in me. Sadly, hardly any productions
did I actually enjoy.</p><ul><li>Lex Fridman Podcast</li></ul><p>Always disappointed by episodes with technical guests. I guess this means
he really seeks to reach large crowds.</p><ul><li>The Joe Rogan Experience</li></ul><p>Took some visceral pleasure from the discussions with athletes and mostly discarded the rest; except for, of course, <em>the Kanye episode</em>.</p><ul><li>Broken Record</li></ul><p>Felt superficial.</p><ul><li>Transfert by slate.fr</li></ul><p>Well-read, moving stories saturating me quickly.</p><h1 id=records>Records</h1><ul><li>Music for Silence - Nick Murphy</li></ul><p>Nick Murphy did what was necessary for me to forget about Run Fast Sleep Naked.</p><ul><li>Igor - Tyler the Creator</li></ul><p>Such complexity, such sophistication - I&rsquo;ve been in awe of Tyler the Creator&rsquo;s work on all fronts.</p><ul><li>Joy as an Act of Resistance - Idles</li></ul><p>I truly appreciated the overarching concept, the attention to detail and of course the energy,
for the actual songwriting seemed a bit dim once I was levelheaded again (as much as I ever get levelheaded, that is).</p><ul><li>The New Abnormal - The Strokes</li></ul><p>It felt gentle and beautiful to me. Gentle and beautiful is of course
not all I&rsquo;d hope for from a The Strokes album after <em>all those years</em>.</p><ul><li>Graal - Christian Löffler</li></ul><p>I loved the songs without lyrics and always felt a slight unease for
the songs withlyrics.</p><ul><li>A Hero&rsquo;s Death - Fontaines DC</li></ul><p>Made me feel much younger than I am.</p><ul><li>In Rainbows - Radiohead</li></ul><p>Previously cherry-picking bits and pieces from The Bends, Kid A and Ok Computer, this has become my single favorite Radiohead album.</p><ul><li>Teens of Denial - Car Seat Headrest</li></ul><p>What a blast. At times slightly cringy, most often excellent, always genuine.</p><ul><li>Not Waving, But Drowning - Loyle Carner</li></ul><p>Sympathy</p><ul><li>Channel Orange - Frank Ocean</li></ul><p>I know I&rsquo;m late to the party.</p><ul><li>The Slow Rush - Tame Impala</li></ul><p>I don&rsquo;t want to be too negative so let&rsquo;s just say: I will, from now on, certainly
do no more &lsquo;full Tame Impala discography&rsquo; sessions anymore.</p><ul><li>Endtroducing - DJ Shadow</li></ul><p>I had always been looking for this without knowing.
Reminded me of RJD2&rsquo;s Deadringer but more aggressive, grimmier, darker.</p><ul><li>Wu Hen - Kamaal Williams</li></ul><p>It just works.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/thoughts>thoughts</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/kklein title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a><a class=soc href=https://twitter.com/kevkle title=Twitter><i data-feather=twitter></i></a></div><div class=footer-info>2022 © Kevin Klein |</div></footer><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=!1;doNotTrack||(window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)},ga.l=+new Date,ga("create","UA-122721044-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview"))</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script>
