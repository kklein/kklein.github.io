<a href=https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-12-22-2022_consuming/>2022</a>,
<a href=https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-12-28-2021_consuming/>2021</a> and
<a href=https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-01-02-2020_consuming/>2020</a>.</p><h1 id=live-recording>Live recording</h1><p>King Krule covered Connan Mockasin&rsquo;s &lsquo;Forever Dolphin Love&rsquo; on Annie
Mac&rsquo;s Radio 1 show. I don&rsquo;t know whether there has been a single day
of the second half of 2023 on which I haven&rsquo;t listened to this
recording.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPGYiC1P1LA">Treat yourself</a></p><h1 id=records>Records</h1><h2 id=when-i-have-fears---the-murder-capital>When I Have Fears - The Murder Capital</h2><p>Wow - this hit me like a train. The album I had long been waiting for without knowing about it. I don&rsquo;t perceive this album as
a truly &lsquo;great&rsquo; album. Rather, parts of it just scratch that itch that nothing else seems to reach. &lsquo;Green and Blue&rsquo; is visceral,
direct and yet avoids being harsh or blunt. I like <a href=https://youtu.be/jQtbKWmIUxs>this live recording</a> quite a bit.
<a href=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/2023/01/07/the-murder-capital-we-just-couldnt-talk-to-each-other-trust-was-a-huge-issue/>This article</a>
from the Irish Times taught me the word &lsquo;suave&rsquo; - meaning elegant, charming, confident - through a description of lead vocalist
James McGovern. I agree.</p><h2 id=on-giacometti---hania-rani>On Giacometti - Hania Rani</h2><p>It took me a moment to warm up to this. I think my main problem was that I&rsquo;d been too spoiled by the sweet sweet nectar of &lsquo;Esja&rsquo; -
big footsteps to fill. I learned to put &lsquo;On Giacometti&rsquo; in a different
category; it seems to be of a rather atmospheric and less stage-filling nature. I&rsquo;m excited for future works of hers.</p><h2 id=ugly---slowthai>UGLY - Slowthai</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve repeatedly caught myself thinking that I find this really original. I think Slowthai does great in channeling
energy on tracks like &lsquo;Selfish&rsquo;, &lsquo;Fuck it Puppet&rsquo;, &lsquo;Tourniquet&rsquo; and &lsquo;Happy&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m still surprised by &lsquo;Sooner&rsquo; and &lsquo;UGLY&rsquo; - they kind
of feel like Babyshambles songs to me, in a good way. While I didn&rsquo;t love the echoing chorus, I thought the verses
of &lsquo;Never Again&rsquo; were solid ballad material.
Overall I admire the creative effort and most songs in isolation - the
album as a whole doesn&rsquo;t necessarily feel super coherent to me.</p><h2 id=selected-ambient-works-85-92---aphex-twin>Selected Ambient Works 85-92 - Aphex Twin</h2><p>I play this when I feel like electronic music but am in presence of
people who aren&rsquo;t into electronic music. I can&rsquo;t wrap my head around
the fact that this is music from the 80s.</p><h2 id=bright-green-field---squid>Bright Green Field - Squid</h2><p>I&rsquo;m glad this kind of music exists.</p><h2 id=horizon-problems---geju>Horizon Problems - Geju</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t feel strongly about it but listened to it quite a bit while programming. I really like the
voice and pronounciation of the guy who ended up being sampled on &lsquo;Heinz&rsquo;.</p><h2 id=scaring-the-hoes---jpegmafia-and-danny-brown>Scaring the Hoes - JPEGMafia and Danny Brown</h2><p>At first, Danny Brown&rsquo;s repetitive, nasal rapping and the 80s
influence in the beats were a bit too much for me. Anthony Fantano&rsquo;s
super high opinion of this made me plow through it a bit more. I
definitely learned to like it.</p><h2 id=v20---gogo-penguin>v2.0 - GoGo Penguin</h2><p>Fairly soothing, yet stimulating.</p><h2 id=james-blake---james-blake>James Blake - James Blake</h2><p>We&rsquo;ve grown close.</p><h2 id=love-what-survives---mount-kimbie>Love What Survives - Mount Kimbie</h2><p>I almost find it a pity that the King Krule feature &lsquo;Blue Lines&rsquo; is on
this album since it feels like a majestic and beautiful light tower
that unfortunately also happens to steal the show from an otherwise
very picturesque yet more dimly lit scenery. I really like this.</p><h2 id=louie---kenny-beats>LOUIE - Kenny Beats</h2><p>Inoffensive; gentle and a bit bland.</p><h2 id=flimsier---king-krule>Flimsier - King Krule</h2><p>My thoughts and feelings on this record are still developing a lot. I can already tell that I admire it, in some way. It does require some effort to listen to and can be a bit abrasive at times -
I guess by design.</p><h2 id=shades-of-blue-madlib-invades-blue-note---madlib>Shades Of Blue: Madlib Invades Blue Note - Madlib</h2><p>It came to me out of nowhere and is no doubt meant to stay.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/thoughts>thoughts</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/kklein rel=me title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>
