obviously too bad to be meant seriously and just bad but
respectable.</p></blockquote><p>DFW, The Depressed person, BIwHM</p><blockquote><p>The word &ldquo;pathetic&rdquo;, the therapist candidly shared, often felt to
her like a defense-mechanism the depressed person used to protect
herself against a listener&rsquo;s possible negative judgements by making
it clear that the depressed person was already judging herself far
more severely than any listener could possibly have the heart to.</p></blockquote><p>DFW, &lsquo;Pop Quiz 9&rsquo;, BIwHM</p><blockquote><p>There are right and fruitful ways to try to &rsquo;empathize&rsquo; with the
reader, but having to try to imagine yourself <em>as</em> the reader is not
one of them; in fact it&rsquo;s perilously close to the dreaded trap of
trying to anticipate whether the reader will &rsquo;like&rsquo; something you&rsquo;re
working on, and both you and the very few other fiction writers
you&rsquo;re friends with know that there is no quicker way to tie
yourself in knots and kill any human urgency in the thing you&rsquo;re
working on that to try to calculate ahead of time whether that thing
will be &rsquo;liked&rsquo;.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Plus of course it almost always turns out that the people at the
party actually <em>didn&rsquo;t</em> like you, for the simple reason that you
seemed so invent and self-conscious the whole time that they got the
creepy subliminal feeling that you were using the party merely as
some sort of stage to perform on and that you barely even noticed
them and that you&rsquo;d probably left without any idea whether you even
liked them or not, which hurts their feelings and causes them to
dislike you [&mldr;]</p></blockquote><p>Nick Cave, Sean O&rsquo;Hagan, Faith, hope and carnage</p><blockquote><p>Yes, otherwise the false line, the meaningless line, will always
ambush you when singing it live.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s about having a deep understanding of what you&rsquo;re doing but, at
the same time, being free enough to let the chips fall where they
may. It&rsquo;s about preparation, but it&rsquo;s also about letting things
happen.</p></blockquote><p>David Bayles & Ted Orland - Art & Fear</p><blockquote><p>What is natural and what is beautiful are, in their purest state,
indistinguishable. Could you improve upon the Circle?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>For most artists, making good art depends upon making lots of art
and <em>any</em> ddevice that carries the first brushstroke to the next
blank canvas has tangible, practical value.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>[&mldr;] J.S. Bach committed to writing a prelude and fugue in each of
the twenty-four keys [&mldr;]</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Fears about artmaking fall into two families: fears about yourself,
and fears about your reception by others. In a general way, fears
about yourself prevent you from doing your <em>best</em> work, while fears
about your reception by others prevent you from doing hour <em>own</em> work.</p></blockquote><p>This NYT article claims that Leonard Cohen has written up to 180
verses for his masterpiece &lsquo;Hallelujah&rsquo;.
