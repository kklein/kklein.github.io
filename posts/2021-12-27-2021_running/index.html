I did something similar in <a href=http://kevinkle.in/jekyll/update/2020/12/26/2020_running.html>2020</a> as well as in <a href=http://kevinkle.in/jekyll/update/2019/12/27/2019_running.html>2019</a>.</p><h1 id=the-gist-of-it>The gist of it</h1><table><thead><tr><th></th><th style=text-align:right>2018</th><th style=text-align:right>2019</th><th style=text-align:right>2020</th><th style=text-align:right>2021</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>distance [km]</td><td style=text-align:right>430</td><td style=text-align:right>962</td><td style=text-align:right>1295</td><td style=text-align:right>1381</td></tr><tr><td>avg distance [km]</td><td style=text-align:right>6.61</td><td style=text-align:right>9.08</td><td style=text-align:right>10.53</td><td style=text-align:right>11.05</td></tr><tr><td>#runs</td><td style=text-align:right>65</td><td style=text-align:right>107</td><td style=text-align:right>123</td><td style=text-align:right>124</td></tr><tr><td>#sports activities</td><td style=text-align:right>81</td><td style=text-align:right>135</td><td style=text-align:right>210</td><td style=text-align:right>231</td></tr><tr><td>share of running among sports activities</td><td style=text-align:right>80.25%</td><td style=text-align:right>79.26%</td><td style=text-align:right>58.57%</td><td style=text-align:right>53.68%</td></tr><tr><td>max duration between 2 runs [days]</td><td style=text-align:right>36</td><td style=text-align:right>26</td><td style=text-align:right>18</td><td style=text-align:right>38</td></tr><tr><td>#weeks without running</td><td style=text-align:right>16</td><td style=text-align:right>5</td><td style=text-align:right>4</td><td style=text-align:right>7</td></tr></tbody></table><p>After picking up going to the gym in late 2019 and starting to cycle every now and then in 2020, I made
the tail end of activities a little longer by hiking, playing tennis, bouldering and swimming just a couple of times -
hence the lower share of running.</p><p>The stark increase in the maximal duration between two runs seems to be the consequence of an injury-ridden spring.</p><h1 id=a-bit-more-than-the-gist-of-it>A bit more than the gist of it</h1><p>The top-left plot, comprising all runs of 2021 and their respective distances, also indicates the injury with a
gaping hole roughly between April and June. Also, it shows both of my attempts to run above-marathon distance.</p><p>The top-right plot still shows some mass of runs between 10am and 4pm, yet I seem to have shifted more runs into morning and
evening than before.</p><p><img src=/imgs/2021_running/2021_compiled_running.png alt=runs></p><p>I figure one could try to read the impact of pollen into the bottom-left plot - since even in 2020 my running tanked
enormously in May. At the same time, my dim memory tells me that I had some light but non-negligible injury in the
summer of 2020 as well. Independently of the cause(s), I seem to have fared better in regaining momentum in the second half
of 2021 than in 2020.</p><p>Overall, it seems like my running might have become a bit more consistent at the monthly aggregation level. This is also
indicated by the bottom-right histogram of monthly distances across years.</p><p>Talking about consistency: Have I been able to accumulate much volume along the span of two weeks?</p><p><img src=/imgs/2021_running/2021_max_distance_consecutive_days.png alt="consecutive days"></p><p>Sort of?</p><h1 id=heart-rate>Heart rate</h1><p>While previously an avid refuser of any running gear of non-trivial sophistication, I let my injury and the physiotherapist
convince me to purchase a watch monitoring my heart rate. The purpose not merely being observation
but rather intervention, I was instructed to start running in <a href=https://www.runnersworld.com/beginner/a20812270/should-i-do-heart-rate-training/>&lsquo;zone 1&rsquo; or &lsquo;zone 2&rsquo;</a>.</p><p>Quickly did I figure out that this is far from what I&rsquo;d been used to. My standard feel-good running pace had usually been
below 5&rsquo;/km. It turned out that this would usually bring me either to the devilish zone 3 or the to-be-savoured-in-small-quantities zone 4. :S:S:S</p><p>As a consequence, I had to reduce my running pace by roughly 50%. This was pretty challenging and took me a long time to get accustomed to.</p><p>Given this, I&rsquo;m pleasantly surprised that my yearly running volume didn&rsquo;t drop too much - neither due to no longer being able to afford the time to run similar distances
at a substantially slower pace nor due to it breaking my morale.</p><p>Anyhow - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fUvTtVfPzE&">some people claim</a> that running in aforementioned zone 2 will diminish heart rates for a given pace in any zone and thereby implicitly &lsquo;make you faster&rsquo;. Hopeful that my sacrifice in speed would also be of some benefit other than preventing injury - what&rsquo;s the worth of that after all - I wondered:</p><blockquote><p>Has my heart rate gotten lower for a fixed pace?</p></blockquote><p>The above question is extremely hard to answer truthfully since the data is neither constant nor independently random across all other dimensions - sleep, weather, distance, elevation, prior
exhaustion and motivation to only name a few. I figured, it could still be that averaging across months, a useful trend could prevail.</p><p>I have resorted to using the Strava API to tackle a proxy for that question. Strava, a second source of running data of mine, connects to my watch and stores both
heart rate and pace data.</p><p><img src=/imgs/2021_running/2021_heart_rates.png alt="heart rates"></p><p>&ldquo;Something, something negatives results&rdquo;, right?</p><p>Code for the analyses based on my calendar data can be found <a href=https://github.com/kklein/gcal-analysis>here</a>.
