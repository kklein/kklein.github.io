Finely chop it and mix it with the remaining batter ingredients. The batter should neither be as liquid as normal pancake batter nor be as sticky as dough - just somewhere in between should be fine. In case your kimchi doesn&rsquo;t hold the suggested amount of kimchi juice, just substitute it with water.</p><p>Place the batter in a high-heat pan coated with a neutral oil. It should be fairly easy to flip them. Aim for a thickness between .5 and .8 cm. Not using too much oil will prevent them to be too heavy and soft.</p><p>Precut the pancakes so they can be dipped in a sauce bowl with chopsticks.</p><p>Garnish with sesame seeds and possibly extra spring onion.</p><h2 id=closing-remarks>Closing remarks</h2><p>I tried out dried seaweed as a complement and substitute for the Kimchi, both of which I can recommend.</p><p>Serving spiralized cucumber and carrot mixed with some of the dipping sauce and fresh coriander makes for a fresh, fitting side dish.</p><p>Many thanks to Giulia. :)</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/recipe>recipe</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/kklein title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a><a class=soc href=https://twitter.com/kevkle title=Twitter><i data-feather=twitter></i></a></div><div class=footer-info>2022 Â© Kevin Klein |</div></footer><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=!1;doNotTrack||(window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)},ga.l=+new Date,ga("create","UA-122721044-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview"))</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script>
