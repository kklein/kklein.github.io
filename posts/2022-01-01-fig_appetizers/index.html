Ingredients Puff pastry Figs (preferably fresh ones; if not, dried ones are ok, too) Ricotta Rocket Method Cut some parts of the puff pastry. I figure both rectangles and squares should work.

Sesame seeds, on the other hand, could have been a good addition - both inside as well as outside of the puff pastry.</p><p>In retrospect I&rsquo;m curious as to how some mustard seeds would&rsquo;ve fared in the ricotta mixture.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/recipe>recipe</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/kklein rel=me title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a>
