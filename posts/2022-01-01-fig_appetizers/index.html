Sesame seeds, on the other hand, could have been a good addition - both inside as well as outside of the puff pastry.</p><p>In retrospect I&rsquo;m curious as to how some mustard seeds would&rsquo;ve fared in the ricotta mixture.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/recipe>recipe</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/kklein title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a><a class=soc href=https://twitter.com/kevkle title=Twitter><i data-feather=twitter></i></a></div><div class=footer-info>2022 Â© Kevin Klein |</div></footer><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=!1;doNotTrack||(window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)},ga.l=+new Date,ga('create','UA-122721044-1','auto'),ga('send','pageview'))</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script>
