When telling myself to not have a certain expectation against someone, I did usually make sure to control my behaviour towards them.

I did usually make sure to control my behaviour towards them. If I
anticipated that I shouldn&rsquo;t have the expectation of an event taking
place, I made sure not to make the responsible person feel

&rsquo;not have had the expectation&rsquo; instead of regarding it as simply one of several
implications.</p><p>Not having an expectation against someone means both not <em>acting</em>
negatively towards that person as well as not thinking or feeling negatively
<em>inside</em>, independently of the behaviour, i.e. act, displayed towards others.</p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/thoughts>thoughts</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/kklein title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a><a class=soc href=https://twitter.com/kevkle title=Twitter><i data-feather=twitter></i></a></div><div class=footer-info>2023 Â© Kevin Klein |</div></footer><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=!1;doNotTrack||(window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)},ga.l=+new Date,ga("create","UA-122721044-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview"))</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script>
