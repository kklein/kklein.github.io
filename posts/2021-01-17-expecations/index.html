<meta name=description content="I caught myself making the mistake of thinking I wasn&rsquo;t holding
expectations when in fact, I was.
When telling myself to not have a certain expectation against someone,
I did usually make sure to control my behaviour towards them. If I
anticipated that I shouldn&rsquo;t have the expectation of an event taking
place, I made sure not to make the responsible person feel
negatively about the non-event. I figured that not holding the
expectation would mean that I may not act upset or angry towards them."><meta property="og:image" content><meta property="og:url" content="https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-01-17-expecations/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Expectations are Twofold"><meta property="og:description" content="I caught myself making the mistake of thinking I wasn’t holding expectations when in fact, I was.

negatively towards that person as well as not thinking or feeling negatively
