<meta name=description content="I have a feeling that hard-boiled eggs are conventially viewed as unsexy. In spite of that,  I gave pickling them a shot.

1 cup of white balsamic vinegar
1/2 cup of liquid from tinned beets
2 tbsp cardamon pods
2 tbsp cumin seeds
2 tbsp coriander seeds
2 tbsp pepper corns
1 tbsp fennel seeds
1 tbsp mustard seeds
a few cloves
a few bay leaves
2 cloves of garlic
2 tbsp curry powder
2 tbsp turmeric
2 tbsp sweet paprika powder
2 tbsp salt
3 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp garam masala

Method
Boil the eggs as little as possible while making sure they&rsquo;re actually boiled. If you found just the right spot, make
sure to put them into ice water as to prevent them continuing to cook themselves."><meta property="og:image" content><meta property="og:url" content="https://kevinkle.in/posts/2020-05-16-eggs/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Blog"><meta property="og:title" content="Orange Pink Eggs"><meta property="og:description" content="I have a feeling that hard-boiled eggs are conventially viewed as unsexy.
