If you found just the right spot, make
sure to put them into ice water as to prevent them continuing to cook themselves.</p><p>In the meantime toast your whole spices in a dry pan on medium heat until your kitchen smells like a market in a
far-flung exotic place. Eventually add the beet juice and ground spices to combine everything well. In particular,
make sure the sure is well disolved. Let cool for a bit.</p><p>Add your spice mixture and the vinegar into your mason jar.</p><p>Peel your hard-boiled eggs and add them, too.</p><p><img src=/imgs/eggs/spices.jpg alt=spices></p><p>I let them pickle for roughly 7-10 days. They looked really cool - orange on the outside and pink on the inside.
They ended up being fairly acidic, partly overshadowing the taste of spices. I think it be cool if one could spare
some of the vinegar, although I&rsquo;m not sure what this would imply for their shelf life.</p><p><img src=/imgs/eggs/outside.jpg alt=outside></p><p><img src=/imgs/eggs/inside.jpg alt=inside></p></section><div class=post-tags><nav class="nav tags"><ul class=tags><li><a href=/tags/recipe>recipe</a></li></ul></nav></div></article></main><footer><div style=display:flex><a class=soc href=https://github.com/kklein title=GitHub><i data-feather=github></i></a><a class=soc href=https://twitter.com/kevkle title=Twitter><i data-feather=twitter></i></a></div><div class=footer-info>2022 Â© Kevin Klein |</div></footer><script type=application/javascript>var doNotTrack=!1;doNotTrack||(window.ga=window.ga||function(){(ga.q=ga.q||[]).push(arguments)},ga.l=+new Date,ga("create","UA-122721044-1","auto"),ga("send","pageview"))</script><script async src=https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js></script>
