I did very similar things in 2022, 2021, 2020 and 2019.
Executive summary The following radar-plot compares the past three years in terms of endurance, variety, strength and consistency:
To my surprise, the plot indicates that the polygons were almost subsets of each other. I was rather suspecting a bunch of trade-offs to appear.</description></item><item><title>Use It or Lose It</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2023-05-30-use_it_or_lose_it/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2023 07:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2023-05-30-use_it_or_lose_it/</guid><description>I long held the belief that knowing things (by heart)1 was both overrated and not too important. Rather, I thought that being able to quickly access and digest information was the only thing that mattered. I still think that the latter is incredibly important, but I changed my mind on the former.
Why remember? Tl;dr: I now think that knowing things matters to some extent and would like to memorize.</description></item><item><title>QoQa Looks Mostly Legit</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-12-29-qoqa/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2022 07:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-12-29-qoqa/</guid><description>What QoQa - I&amp;rsquo;m still very unsure about its pronunciation - is a Swiss e-commerce business. Per product category - of which there are ten - they usually offer a single product at a time. A given product is offered at a supposedly low price point during a fairly short time window, usually hours or days. Importantly, it is advertised as though QoQa had access to a fixed amount of stock per product.</description></item><item><title>2022 in Exercise</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-12-27-2022_running/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Dec 2022 02:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-12-27-2022_running/</guid><description>As another year is coming to an end I&amp;rsquo;m curious: What does the exercise data have to tell me?

Often it&amp;rsquo;s been ads, say a Greenpeace collage of small images portraying poorly treated puppies - that is, if you&amp;rsquo;re able to squint your eyes real hard - making up for the overall image of a happy dolphin, or so.
Anyhow! - I&amp;rsquo;ve almost always found these collages to be aesthetically displeasing. At the same time they somehow caught and kept my attention.</description></item><item><title>Inference</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-06-06-inference/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jun 2022 07:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-06-06-inference/</guid><description>I had long felt a slight discomfort with the word &amp;lsquo;inference&amp;rsquo;. Many people seemed to use it with confidence and the expectation that it would refer to a precise notion. And while it is not uncommon for a word to have different meaning in different contexts, it took me a while to figure out what the different meaning and what the different contexts are in the example of &amp;lsquo;inference&amp;rsquo;. Some other people seem to be a little confused as well.</description></item><item><title>Life Monitor</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-05-21-life_monitor/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2022 07:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-05-21-life_monitor/</guid><description>Motivation On the one hand, there are things we notice &amp;lsquo;automatically&amp;rsquo;, easily, without consciously paying attention to them. On the other hand, there are things that slip through the cracks unless we make a point out of monitoring them.
It might seem very natural that whether something is effortlessly &amp;lsquo;visible&amp;rsquo; is highly dependent on other properties of that very same something. It occurred to me that I have a tendency to be less receptive for observations that</description></item><item><title>Org Log</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-02-27-org_journal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 09:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-02-27-org_journal/</guid><description>I have long been an avid enthusiast of journaling. This has mostly been for the sheer sake of journaling. In other words: once written, never to be read.
At the same time I would like to use information about my past when making decisions for the future. When simply winging this inference on empirical data, I&amp;rsquo;m always worried that some warping could have altered my recollection of these experiences (in other words: a noisy communication channel) and thereby bias my inference mechanism unjustly.</description></item><item><title>Sudoku #3: Poor Man's RL</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-01-09-sudoku_rl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2022 08:00:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-01-09-sudoku_rl/</guid><description>Previously, I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined some ideas on how to solve Suduko puzzles. One revolved around depth-first search in trees, one around linear programming. This time I tried my luck with a more adventurous, data-driven approach: Reinforcement Learning. First things first: the approach only works well for 4x4 grids - not for the typical 9x9. Please note that the approached subsequently outlined couldn&amp;rsquo;t be further from a recommendable approach to solving Sudoku puzzles.</description></item><item><title>2021 in Running</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-12-27-2021_running/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 02:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-12-27-2021_running/</guid><description>As another year is coming to an end I&amp;rsquo;m curious: What has my running looked like this year?

Different algorithms ought to still lead to the same solution, since a correct Sudoku puzzle comes with a unique solution. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll rely on optimization&amp;rsquo;s poster child: Linear programming.
Idea A linear program, subsequently referred to as LP, comes with three central building blocks:
An objective function Typically many variables, each, a priori, non-integer numbers Linear constraints on the variables Since, thanks to our assumption of a well-posed puzzle we know that:</description></item><item><title>Sudoku #1: Depth-First Search</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-02-28-sudoku_dfs/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2021 19:00:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-02-28-sudoku_dfs/</guid><description>Abstract Solving a Sudoku board can be done in many ways. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore a depth-first search approach in this post.
Idea Depth-first search or DFS implies (at least) two things:
a graph, or rather, a tree a search This bares the question: What&amp;rsquo;s the tree and what are we searching for?
The tree A tree must consist of nodes and edges. We define the nodes to represent a &amp;lsquo;state&amp;rsquo; of the game.</description></item><item><title>2020 in Running</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2020-12-27-2020_running/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Dec 2020 00:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2020-12-27-2020_running/</guid><description>Yet another year&amp;rsquo;s almost over.

I will attempt to introduce some notions for general context without derivations. Googling will lead to plenty of useful resources. On an introductory level, I enjoyed Daphne Koller&amp;rsquo;s class.

On the one hand I find this immensely exciting:
A friend takes time to share something with me. I take pleasure in exploring music per se. Both conjuncted, there is a possibility to bond over music. Hence there is a great amount of potential!
Yet, on the other hand, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a mess.</description></item><item><title>Update: Time Is Money</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2020-03-26-tim_update/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2020 16:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2020-03-26-tim_update/</guid><description>A while back, I wrote about Time Is Money.
Back then I ran into several technical problems with modern browsers&amp;rsquo; idle api.

As I&amp;rsquo;m not aware of a conventionally used synonym for the former use of &amp;rsquo;log&amp;rsquo; and the latter is usually referred to as &amp;rsquo;log&amp;rsquo; in mathematics (thereby rejecting the argument I would usually bring up in naming issues: avoid abbreviations and acronyms) a naming problem naturally arises.</description></item><item><title>2019 in Running</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2019-12-26-2019_running/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2019 16:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2019-12-26-2019_running/</guid><description>As explained in a previous post, I log the distances of my runs. In the following I will make some simple observations based on this data. The data goes back to 2016 and comprises timestamps and running distances in km.
In bad storytelling manner let&amp;rsquo;s start with the most graspable and interesting statistic first: average and overall distance across years. I had never computed those before and had basically no intuition on it at all.</description></item><item><title>Sort-of-art?</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2019-09-27-lena/</link><pubDate>Fri, 27 Sep 2019 08:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2019-09-27-lena/</guid><description>Recently, my friend Theo pointed me towards his amazing idea and execution of programming &amp;lsquo;paintings&amp;rsquo; with the help of randomization.
I was fairly taken by the idea of programming with randomization to create sort-of-art. I kept thinking about cellular automata but reckoned that they often created outcomes that looked:
overly structured in general busy, hard and cold in detail. I figured that the latter could maybe be tackled by applying lots of smoothing, both on input and output image.</description></item><item><title>Workflow on Leonhard/Euler Compute Cluster</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2019-02-28-leonhard/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Feb 2019 18:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2019-02-28-leonhard/</guid><description>Abstract Fortunately, ETH provides many of its students with access to Leonhard and Euler, computer clusters with CPUs and GPUs. Note that not every student is granted access to both - only some coursework or projects might qualify.

Why Whether you&amp;rsquo;re using sklearn transformations already or implementing data wrangling from scratch, there are interesting aspects to squeezing those into an sklearn pipeline. Most notably, this will:
Allow for the usage of sklearn&amp;rsquo;s cross validation. Allow for the usage of sklearn&amp;rsquo;s grid search. Lower the barrier to include sklearn transformations, such as TfidfVectorizer, in the future. It would be possible to do all such processing without a pipeline object: once on the whole dataset.</description></item><item><title>Running Log</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2018-10-21-running-log/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Oct 2018 16:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2018-10-21-running-log/</guid><description>Problem Sports tracking apps offer lots of interesting functionalities regarding the logging of activities. I figured most of what they provided was only interesting in short-term for two reasons.
On the one hand, I changed phones and tracking apps from time to time, which would sometimes lead to a reset of information. Also, some tracking apps were discontinued. You could say they introduced technical debt that I often was not willing or able to carry on.</description></item><item><title>Time Is Money</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2018-07-29-tim/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Aug 2018 16:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2018-07-29-tim/</guid><description>This post is about a browser add-on that is hopefully a drop in the ocean towards a rather ambitious goal. It&amp;rsquo;s called TimeIsMoney.
Motivation A while back I listened to Sam Harris&amp;rsquo; podcast with Tristan Harris. What remained was following:
I agreed that most technology is agnostic. At the same time, a lot of technology stemming from or being a byproduct of the attention economy is rather geared towards a usage that is a net disadvantage for the user.</description></item><item><title>Matrix Factorization in Collaborative Filtering</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2018-07-10-cf-mf/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2018 16:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2018-07-10-cf-mf/</guid><description>The Task We are given a set of tuples representing user-movie ratings, \(\mathcal{R} = \{(i,j,r)\}\), where \(i\) is the user index, \(j\) is the movie index and \(r \in [0, \dots, 5]\) the rating. In the most common scenarios, only a fraction of all user-movie pairs are rated, hence we can talk about sparse data. In other words, most users have only rated a few movies. Now we want to obtain sensible predictions for movies a user has not rated.</description></item></channel></rss>
