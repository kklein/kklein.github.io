Moreover, we propose an algorithm inspired by Thompson sampling to identify the m best arms in a pure exploration scenario.

This work explores the use of classic matrix factorization methods on the one hand and recent neural network-based methods on the other hand. Final predictions were further improved using ensembling methods such as bagging and stacking. We report similar, competitive scores for matrix factorization methods and slightly lower accuracy for neural network-based methods with a final ensemble RMSE of 0.964.</p><p>This project was collaborative work with <a href=https://benjaminha.hn/>Benjamin Hahn</a> and <a href=https://www.lorenzkuhn.com/>Lorenz Kuhn</a>.
