&lt;p>I think this is my favourite BADBADNOTGOOD album. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel as
excessively playful, more authentic than other works of theirs to me. More necessity, less luxury.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>It Depends</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2024-12-22-micro-macro/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2024 07:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2024-12-22-micro-macro/</guid><description>&lt;p>Generally speaking our behaviors (both actual and ideal), morals or personalities are very sensitive to the intricate contexts of life.
It took me a while to realize that my behaviors and ideals in a given dimension are sensitive to whether I&amp;rsquo;m under the impression of dealing
with an individual &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;micro&amp;rsquo; &amp;ndash; or with an entity, an abstract organization or society as a whole &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;macro&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following are few tendencies of mine I believe to have observed. In these dimensions, the behavior and morals I live and expect depend a lot on micro vs. macro:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No More Breakpoints?</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2024-07-20-breakpoints/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2024 07:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2024-07-20-breakpoints/</guid><description>&lt;p>I am way past a stage of a crush or merely being in love when it comes to &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html">&lt;code>pdb&lt;/code>&lt;/a>; I&amp;rsquo;d rather call it a deep love.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Miracurously I have perceived it to be both very flexible and powerful for advanced users as well as very simple and thereby beginner-friendly when catering to rather simple use cases.
What adds to my appreciation for &lt;code>pdb&lt;/code> is that - unlike, afaict, most debuggers - it sits rather with the code than the IDE. This agnosticity to IDEs or systems makes it very portable and convenient to use in many different environments, e.g. whenever you only have a terminal access to a machine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Analyzing Advent of Code</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2024-01-05-aoc/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jan 2024 07:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2024-01-05-aoc/</guid><description>&lt;p>2023 came with another edition of &lt;a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code&lt;/a>, an

&lt;p>In many ways - e.g. the assessment of both performance of and correctness on official leaderboards - the programming
challenges are similar to regular programming competitions. Yet, there is also a large part of the community
approaching Advent of Code more casually: people playing around with funky programming languages (e.g. &lt;a href="https://github.com/crazazy/aoc2020">Nix&lt;/a> or &lt;a href="https://github.com/eversinc33/Red-Team-Advent-of-Code">Nim&lt;/a>) or people &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmIcX2SHojI">streaming their daily programming sessions&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2023 in Exercise</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2023-12-28-2023_running/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Dec 2023 02:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2023-12-28-2023_running/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since another year has come to an end, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but be curious: What does the exercise data have to tell me?

&lt;p>To my surprise, the plot indicates that the polygons were almost subsets of each other. I was rather suspecting a bunch of
trade-offs to appear. In other words: the years have mostly improved in these four metrics. :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2023 in Music</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2023-12-31-2023_consuming/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 12:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2023-12-31-2023_consuming/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just rambling about some music I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to in 2023.

&lt;p>Wow - this hit me like a train. The album I had long been waiting for without knowing about it. I don&amp;rsquo;t perceive this album as
a truly &amp;lsquo;great&amp;rsquo; album. Rather, parts of it just scratch that itch that nothing else seems to reach. &amp;lsquo;Green and Blue&amp;rsquo; is visceral,
direct and yet avoids being harsh or blunt. I like &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jQtbKWmIUxs">this live recording&lt;/a> quite a bit.

&lt;p>There are various ways of trying to assess the value of something. For instance, one might
define the value of a resource by how much someone else is willing to pay for it. In the domain of
time, we could ask the question of the hourly rate someone is willing to pay for our time/labor
and consider that the value of our time.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Eggplant Parmigiana</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2023-04-08-parmigiana/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Apr 2023 07:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2023-04-08-parmigiana/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Serves four people.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the sauce:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>1.5 kg of tinned, diced tomatoes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>5 onions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>100g of sundried tomatoes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>100g of dried artichokes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>6 cloves of garlic&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 tsp of fennel seeds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>some capers&lt;/li>
&lt;li>some red wine&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Not for the sauce:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>5 eggplants&lt;/li>
&lt;li>450 g of mozzarella&lt;/li>
&lt;li>150g of Parmesan cheese&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 large bunches of basil&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For the side salad:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>500g of baby leaf spinach&lt;/li>
&lt;li>100g of fairly soft sheep&amp;rsquo;s cheese&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 grapefruit&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Cut the eggplants in slices of roughly half a centimeter. Put them in a bowl and lavishly salt them - the idea being
water being drained from them. I would recommend letting them drain for at least half an hour. If you want to go the extra
mile, you can pat them dry every now and then.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I See Red</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2023-01-15-beets-labneh/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 07:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2023-01-15-beets-labneh/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="ingredients">Ingredients&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Assume you are working with a decision tree which as been constructed by a learning
algorithm. Further assume that some of the leaves are relevant while others aren&amp;rsquo;t.
For example, it could be that the outcome modeled in leaves corresponds to the probability
of a successful surgery. In order to use this model for prediction/inference in production,
one might imagine stripping all of its unnecessary parts. To be concrete, all
of the leaves with a success probability which is no sufficiently high become irrelevant:
the applicant might define a threshold, e.g. 80%, and not carry out a surgery below
that probability. In this case, the applicant doesn&amp;rsquo;t care whether the prediction was
50% or 30% - just below 80%.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Cheat Sheet for Information Theory Fundamentals in ML</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-12-31-information_theory/</link><pubDate>Sat, 31 Dec 2022 07:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2022-12-31-information_theory/</guid><description>&lt;p>All of the definitions stem from Kevin Murphy&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html">Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

was by design, acknowledging my dependence on running. Partially it has been fostered

What we care about is for the attendants to have a good time - which we assume to be purely determined by who else is attending. If two people like each other and are both present, their experience improves.

&lt;p>Personally, I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a difficult relation to &amp;lsquo;goals&amp;rsquo;.

&lt;p>Cut some parts of the puff pastry. I figure both rectangles and squares should work.

In the same vein, I would try to make the pastry as thin as possible.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2021 in Consuming</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-12-28-2021_consuming/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 12:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-12-28-2021_consuming/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just rambling about some books, music and podcasts I&amp;rsquo;ve been exposed to in 2021.

&lt;p>I much preferred the short story about the dynamics of professional tennis over DFW&amp;rsquo;s hesitant adventures on the high seas after which the book is titled. The distinguishing quality might have been positivity. While tries to convey a lot of criticism and scepticism towards tennis, yet can&amp;rsquo;t help but let raw rays of juvenile sunshine through his cover of rationality. This makes the short story about tennis feel like a net positive description to me. This was unexpected and heartwarming - given the somber nature of DFW&amp;rsquo;s personality. His short story about the his time on a cruise ship seemed purely cynical and negative. Maybe the classic &amp;lsquo;you dislike others for what you dislike with yourself&amp;rsquo; hits here: he might have reminded me of my occasional doom and gloom a tad too much. :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2021 in Running</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-12-27-2021_running/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 02:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-12-27-2021_running/</guid><description>&lt;p>As another year is coming to an end I&amp;rsquo;m curious: What has my running looked like this year?

&lt;p>As discussed in &lt;a href="http://kevinkle.in/jekyll/update/2021/02/28/sudoku_dfs.html">this previous post&lt;/a>,
a given Sudoku puzzle can be modeled in a multitude of ways. Different algorithms ought to still
lead to the same solution, since a correct Sudoku puzzle comes with a unique solution. In this

&lt;p>Solving a Sudoku board can be done in many ways. Let&amp;rsquo;s explore a depth-first search approach in this post.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="idea">Idea&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Depth-first search or DFS implies (at least) two things:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a graph, or rather, a tree&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a search&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This bares the question: What&amp;rsquo;s the tree and what are we searching for?&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="the-tree">The tree&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>A tree must consist of nodes and edges. We define the nodes to represent a &amp;lsquo;state&amp;rsquo; of the game. A state of the game is meant to be a snapshot of the Sudoku board, i.e. a mapping from cells, e.g. 2nd row, 6th column, to values, e.g. 7 or &amp;rsquo;empty&amp;rsquo;. Every edge in the tree represents an &amp;lsquo;action&amp;rsquo;, i.e. the addition or removal of a cell value.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Expectations are Twofold</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-01-17-expecations/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Jan 2021 16:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-01-17-expecations/</guid><description>&lt;p>I caught myself making the mistake of thinking I wasn&amp;rsquo;t holding
expectations when in fact, I was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When telling myself to not have a certain expectation against someone,
I did usually make sure to control my behaviour towards them. If I
anticipated that I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have the expectation of an event taking
place, I made sure not to make the responsible person feel
negatively about the non-event. I figured that not holding the
expectation would mean that I may not act upset or angry towards them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I Could Care Less</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-01-13-caring/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Jan 2021 18:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2021-01-13-caring/</guid><description>&lt;p>While I think that I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing okay when it comes to not caring
too much about other people&amp;rsquo;s perception of me, I believe to have

&lt;p>I think there is still a distinction to be made when it comes to
&amp;lsquo;caring&amp;rsquo;. I feel like there is a qualitative difference between caring
about what exactly others think of me when in their presence and
caring about an imagine I have of myself - hypothetically representing

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve often felt strongly about gifts made and received and always had some vague intuitions floating around in my head concerning distinctive properties.
Finally have I sought to distill them and make them more explicit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reflecting on past gift-finding processes, I came to realize that I would often feel dissatisfied when most of the value of
a gift would stem from money. I&amp;rsquo;d much rather have the value be derived from thought, concern and genuine interest about someone.
This topic concerns itself with the &lt;em>kind of effort&lt;/em>. Within this kind of currency, efforts can still be misdirected. Pondering without
getting anywhere is likely a common phenomenon. What&amp;rsquo;s the purpose of spending the &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; kind of effort
without ensuing reward? Hence, within the realm of spending thought on someone, I would attempt to direct them towards my own edge. In the

While
I&amp;rsquo;ve often got there by covering it in honey and balsamic vinegar, I
was inclined to look for a similar effect with actual grapes. In
additional to the lovely interplay of bitterness and sweetness, there
is something light about the acidity of the grapes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I figured that caramelized onions would only enhance this interplay
without distracting too much.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Combining Gorgonzola with pasta water can easily lead to a very creamy
cover for the pasta, as can be achieved with other types of
cheeses. Yet, the blue cheese combines the silky, creamy texture with
a sharpness in taste that pleasantly surprises.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Markov Random Field Image Denoising</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2020-03-27-mrf/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Apr 2020 09:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2020-03-27-mrf/</guid><description>&lt;p>This post describes the application of a Probabilistic Graphical Model for simple image denoising,

&lt;p>Why care about conditional independencies? Joint distributions can always be expressed without
conditional independencies. Yet, the latter allow for an expression of the joint distribution

&lt;p>You are the host of an event for which there are \(n\) candidates to be invited and you possess sufficient resources to host all candidates. Let the nature of the event be such that it seems personally attached to you, yet also fairly polarizing in its experience. In other words:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>some invitees will have a desire to decline&lt;/li>
&lt;li>invitees with a desire to decline will feel bad about declining&lt;/li>

&lt;li>non-invitees with a desire to attend will feel bad about not being able to attend&lt;/li>

Said bandwidth was reason enough for me to believe that nothing &lt;em>meaningful&lt;/em> would come out of it.

&lt;p>Pipeline of transforms with a final estimator.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="why">Why&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Whether you&amp;rsquo;re using sklearn transformations already or implementing data wrangling from scratch, there are interesting aspects to squeezing those into an sklearn
&lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html">pipeline&lt;/a>.
Most notably, this will:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Allow for the usage of sklearn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score.html">cross validation&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allow for the usage of sklearn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html">grid search&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Lower the barrier to include sklearn transformations, such as &lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html">TfidfVectorizer&lt;/a>, in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It would be possible to do all such processing without a pipeline object: once
on the whole dataset. Yet, this is only legitimate for data-independent [0]
transformations. For data-dependent transformations, such as imputation by mean,
you would cause data leakage [1]. In order to avoid that, we can express how
training and validation set should be processed individually, per cross
validation split.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running Log</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2018-10-21-running-log/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Oct 2018 16:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2018-10-21-running-log/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="problem">Problem&lt;/h2>

Such advice might be useful at times, yet I believe that the upper bound of created value by such concrete yet context-insensitive advice is low.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My impression is that most valuable decisions are context-sensitive by nature, i.e. relying on a lot of individual, complex information. The overwhelming complexity and volume of context can be mistakenly overlooked when formulating advice. A person&amp;rsquo;s full context, i.e. the state of the world, usually can&amp;rsquo;t easily be folded into a simple, exchangeable description. Therefore external advisers use a poor approximation of the context and miss out on crafting fitting, useful, context-sensitive suggestions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Apologies: A Poor Man's Taxonomy</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2018-09-09-apologies/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Sep 2018 16:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2018-09-09-apologies/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have gotten confused and frustrated over apologies from time to time.

&lt;p>I agreed that most technology is agnostic. At the same time, a lot of technology stemming from or being a byproduct of the attention economy is rather geared towards a usage that is a net disadvantage for the user. What I mean by that is that such technology has both advantages and disadvantages that can at least partly be isolated. Yet a somewhat unconscious usage, think: path of least resistance, will often weigh the disadvantages more heavily. I don&amp;rsquo;t see why this would be an intrinsic property of such products and services, it just happens to be the case for most examples I could think of.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Matrix Factorization in Collaborative Filtering</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2018-07-10-cf-mf/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jul 2018 16:38:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/posts/2018-07-10-cf-mf/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-task">The Task&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>We are given a set of tuples representing user-movie ratings, \(\mathcal{R} = \{(i,j,r)\}\), where \(i\) is the user index, \(j\) is the movie index and \(r \in [0, \dots, 5]\) the rating.
In the most common scenarios, only a fraction of all user-movie pairs are rated, hence we can talk about &lt;em>sparse&lt;/em> data.
In other words, most users have only rated a few movies. Now we want to obtain sensible predictions for movies a user has not rated. I leave drawing to picture as to why this is super relevant in many use cases to your imagination. Note that we only have this explicit feedback from users and don&amp;rsquo;t have any context knowledge about the users or movies. We can only leverage ratings from other users to build predictions.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>An excerpt from a series of poems from the uncanny valley between
obviously too bad to be meant seriously and just bad but
respectable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>DFW, The Depressed person, BIwHM&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The word &amp;ldquo;pathetic&amp;rdquo;, the therapist candidly shared, often felt to
her like a defense-mechanism the depressed person used to protect
herself against a listener&amp;rsquo;s possible negative judgements by making
it clear that the depressed person was already judging herself far
more severely than any listener could possibly have the heart to.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/about/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m Kevin. I&amp;rsquo;m a Computer Scientist. You can find me on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kevkle">Twitter&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/kklein">GitHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I enjoy attempting to derive from first principles &amp;ndash; in math, programming or in real life&amp;rsquo;s decision making. Professionally, I do work in Data Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning Engineering, Software Engineering and Quantitative Analysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On this website I try to share my views in order to force myself to condense and distill thoughts and ideas freely floating around in my mind. Moreover, I don&amp;rsquo;t write with the primary intention to let others know. Rather, I have the intention to be transparent and increase my attack surface - making it easier for people to let me know what and how I can do better. If nevertheless someone happens to take something away from my writing, all the better!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://kevinkle.in/projects/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://kevinkle.in/projects/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="quantco">QuantCo&lt;/h1>
